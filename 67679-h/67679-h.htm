<p class="drop-cap2">AT FIVE o&#8217;clock of a September evening, Helen
Sholto left the office, as usual, and went to her
club. Opposite the tube lift in Dover Street, London,
out of which she came, was a bookstall. Clamoring
across the front, a newsbill at once caught the eye of an
informed modern woman:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">

<tr><td class="news"><span class="large">&nbsp; &nbsp; BRITAIN AND AMERICA &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="news">AMAZING SPEECH BY</td></tr>
<tr><td class="news">JOHN ENDOR, M.P.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>She bought a copy of the <i>Evening Press</i>. Looking
it quickly through, she found in the column for late
news a blurred, hastily-inserted paragraph</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">

<tr><td class="news"><span class="large">THE ANGLO-AMERICAN<br />
SITUATION</span></td></tr>

<tr><td class="news2">Speaking to-day at Blackhampton Town<br />
Hall at a luncheon given in his honor,<br />
John Endor, M.P., said that this country&#8217;s<br />
relations with America were bound to<br />
prove a source of continual and growing<br />
anxiety. Dangerous, subterranean<br />
influences were at work on both sides of<br />
the Atlantic. In many things of vital<br />
importance the two nations would never<br />
see eye to eye. Let the people of these<br />
islands always stand ready. Personally,<br />
he believed in the Sword.</td></tr>
</table>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>Helen gasped. The words were like icy water
thrown in the face. And the sensation of having had
all the breath taken out of her body was increased by
the knowledge that a second purchaser of the <i>Evening
Press</i>, a rough-looking workman, standing by her elbow,
had given a savage exclamation. Moreover, in
the act of so doing, by that process of telepathy beyond
whose threshold Science has yet to peer, he caught the
distracted eyes of the particularly attractive-looking
girl who was folding up her own copy of the paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does for him, I reckon!&#8221; And the man spat
savagely.</p>

<p>Helen turned abruptly away, and walked slowly
along Dover Street. A thousand imps were loose in
her brain. Space, quiet, solitude were needed in which
to quell them, to bring them under control. Almost it
was as if the bottom had fallen out of the world in
which she lived.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Helicon Club was at the end of the street.
Women interested in literature, the arts, in social
and public affairs could lunch, dine, entertain their
friends in this oasis. Its pleasant rooms were large
and cool, and, crowning boon in the very heart of
modern Babylon, they offered even a measure of isolation.
For the members&#8217; roll did not respond too readily
to the length of &#8220;the waiting list.&#8221;</p>

<p>A nook of the &#8220;silence&#8221; room enabled Helen to think
her thoughts with the help of a well-earned cup of tea.
And a second look at the evening paper cast one ray
upon the darkness. &#8220;I believe in the Sword.&#8221; The
phrase hurt like a blow, yet somehow it forced the conclusion
upon her that the speech could not have been
reported accurately. Knowing John Endor so well, she
could not bring herself to believe that those were the
words he had used. It hardly seemed credible that
without some hint beforehand he should go back on all
that he stood for in political life.</p>

<p>Bent on setting doubt at rest, she went presently to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
the telephone and rang up John&#8217;s chambers in Bury
Street. She was informed that Mr. Endor had not
yet returned from Blackhampton, but that he was expected
home about half past seven. Thereupon she
left a message, asking him, if not otherwise engaged,
to come and dine with her, adding the little feminine
proviso that &#8220;he was not to dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then a quarter to six. Two hours slowly
passed. Helen had letters to write, a book deeply interesting
to look at. Much was said, all the same, for
her mental habit that, with a grim specter in the outskirts
of her mind, she could yet dragoon her will to the
task of putting it away.</p>

<p>A few minutes before eight John arrived. She went
to him at once. The glow of her greeting masked a
tumult of feeling. None could have guessed from such
<i>entrain</i> that she was facing a crisis upon whose issue
her whole life must turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a piece of luck that you were able to come!&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes and the laugh of a man deeply in love proclaimed
this happy chance to be even more than that.</p>

<p>With no other preface, Helen led the way to the
dining room. Before one question could be put to a
hard-driven politician he must be fed. No matter what
her own emotions might immediately dictate, she had
a sense, almost masculine, of the rules of the game.
Hers was a powerfully disciplined nature. A terrible
phrase seared her like an acid, but for the time being
sheer stoicism allowed her to bear the pain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>A table had been commandeered without difficulty in
a favorite corner. Only a few of the Club habitu&eacute;s
were dining, but John Endor brought a new interest
into the room. It was no more than the emotion he
was accustomed to excite. He leapt to the eye of every
assembly. A force, a magnet, the lines of a rare personality
made an effect of positive beauty. Nearly all
women were attracted by him.</p>

<p>Well over six feet high, thin almost to emaciation,
pale with the cast of thought, his high cheek-bones
seemed to accentuate the hollows beneath them. The
poise of the head and the features exquisitely bold
might have been lures for the chisel of Pheidias; the
deep eyes with their in-striking glances were those of
a seer. Moving with freedom and grace, he had the
look of a man who has seen a vision of the eternal.
Nature at last seemed to have come near that which
through the centuries she had been in search of. In
the mind and mansion of John Endor her only concern
was ultimate things.</p>

<p>As he crossed the wide room, intense curiosity tinged
in some cases by an open admiration, was in the gaze
of the other diners. Yet this did not apply to all. The
curiosity was universal, but in one or two instances
there was also a steady, level-lidded hostility. Helen
was conscious of this as she piloted him to their table,
perhaps because it was to be expected; but in this rising
politician who had Gladstone&#8217;s power of arousing
strong yet diverse emotion wherever he went there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
an apartness which lifted him far beyond the plane
whereon friend gives the countercheck to foe.</p>

<p>It was a good dinner. And the guest, for all his air
of other-worldliness, had none of that rather dubious
breeding which holds itself indifferent to what it eats
and drinks. He complimented his hostess upon a modest
sole Colbert and a poulet en casserole&mdash;the Club
chef he assured her had nothing to learn from Saint
James&#8217;s Street and Pall Mall; to the claret he rendered
all the honors of a vintage wine; in a word, John Endor&#8217;s
look of high ascetism did not taboo the minor
arts of life.</p>

<p>It was this zest in everything which made him such
a lovable companion. The seer, the visionary, was
a man of the world. In spite of his dedication, in spite
of the inward fire of the prophets of old, he had that
subtle appreciation of the human comedy which is one
of the final graces of a liberal education.</p>

<p>This evening, as always, he was charming. Helen
could not help yielding to his attraction, no matter how
strict her guard against it; she could not help being
fascinated by his mental outlook and being lulled, even
a little dangerously, by the personality of the man she
loved. Listening to him now made it seem almost
tragic that one should have to put the question she had
summoned him to ask.</p>

<p>Delays are perilous. Twice before the enchanted
meal was through she was at the point of sending for
the evening paper, so that she might learn the truth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
The fallibility of the newspaper press was still her
hope. But while he talked as only he could, it seemed
an act of barbarism to open the case so crudely. While
his fancy and his humor played upon a hundred things
how could one sidetrack him with such a doubt? There
was some absurd mistake. High faith in this hero bade
her take care.</p>

<p>Almost before she knew that she had let a precious
moment go, she found herself bitterly rueing the fact.
One of his odd, quick, unforeseen turns brought her
up dead against an impasse she would have given much
to avoid.</p>

<p>Plunging an impetuous hand in his coat, he suddenly
produced a half sheet of notepaper, and tossed it over
the table into her lap. &#8220;High time,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;we
let the dear old <i>Morning Post</i> into our <i>secret de
Polichinelle</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>She unfolded the slip of paper and read with a pang
of dismay:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td class="news2">An engagement is announced between<br />
John Endor, only son of the late Myles<br />
Endor, Wyndham, Middleshire, and<br />
Lady Elizabeth Endor, and Helen Mary,<br />
eldest daughter of James Lee Sholto and<br />
Mrs. Sholto of Longmore, Richmond,<br />
Virginia, U. S. A.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>&#8220;Will it meet the case?&#8221; The question was whimsically
direct, even without the enforcement of his
amused eyes.</p>

<p>The blood burned slowly vivid in her face. Happily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the quality or absence of quality in the electric light
prevented his seeing it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;&mdash;in a gay whisper.</p>

<p>There was no escape. &#8220;One shrinks&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Her
will cut the phrase in two. To have completed it
would have been to say too little or too much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s secret,&#8221; he laughed.</p>

<p>As she felt the knife edge of the irony lurking in
the situation, she gave a little gasp. There was only
one thing for her now. She must harden her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t realized,&#8221; she said, in her soft voice, a
delicious blend of the Old World and the New, &#8220;that
your speech to-day was going to be so important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite the last word for it,&#8221; he said, lightly. &#8220;A
heart-to-heart talk, don&#8217;t you know, with a few friends
and constituents. For some dark reason they insisted
on giving me a lovely bit of old Sheffield plate&mdash;and
a scroll. One mustn&#8217;t forget the scroll. Perhaps the
birds have been talking. Anyhow, the Chairman
thought the salver would look very nice on the dining-room
sideboard of a newly married couple!&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited for her laugh, but only one tiny segment
of her mind was listening.</p>

<p>&#8220;It fills the entire placard of the <i>Evening Press</i>.&#8221;
She dare not look at him. There was a clutch at her
heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! My jawbation! Shade of the sea serpent
and the giant gooseberry!&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt the beat of her heart strike upwards. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
throat was filled by it. He sounded hardly more than
a laughing, irresponsible boy. And yet the hour was
surely near when even his lighter grace notes must
prove organ tones in the strained ear of the time.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE fates were at her elbow. As she sent for the
<i>Evening Press</i>, she realized that fact to the full.
Afraid to turn again to her occupation of the last three
hours, the weighing of her love for John Endor, she
was yet unable to escape the challenge of a dire event.
Truly a woman, yet beyond all things she was an
American citizen. No matter what his spells, she
could never marry a man of these ideas. Her country
must stand first.</p>

<p>The <i>Evening Press</i> arrived. Folding back the sheet,
the rather unpretty sheet with its crude headlines and
blurred ink, she placed a finger on the fatal paragraph.</p>

<p>While he read she watched him. But his face was
hidden by the paper and it was not until a slow perusal
was at an end that it came again into view. So great
was the change that it struck her almost with fear.
The allure was gone; such a depth of pallor had the
look of death itself. But the eyes were blazing and
the large, mobile orator&#8217;s mouth was clenched in a
vain effort to control its emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blackguards!&#8221; he gasped. She saw that in his eyes
were tears. Her brain was numb, yet the glow racing
through her veins was sheer joy. The question was
answered; every doubt was laid. So much for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
woman. And in that moment the woman was paramount.
But in the balanced mind, delicately poised,
acutely commonsensible, was now a concern beyond
the personal. What was the meaning of it all?</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew of course ... I felt ... that you had
been ... misreported.&#8221;... Her words were tentative,
inadequate. Painfully watching the man opposite
she knew only too well that the John Endor of
three minutes back might never have been. The play,
the interplay, of changing lights upon his face and in
his eyes were beyond her ken. Almost for the first
time she began to have a real perception of the infinities
within him, of that central power which could sweep a
great audience off its feet.</p>

<p>Of a sudden he sprang fiercely from his chair.
&#8220;It&#8217;s devilish!&#8221; His voice was hoarse. &#8220;Absolutely
devilish!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardly had he used the words when the pain in her
eyes reined him back. Abruptly as he had risen, he
sat down again at the table. &#8220;I beg your pardon!&#8221;
he said. &#8220;But, you see, it&#8217;s a stab in the back&mdash;from
the world&#8217;s most accomplished assassin.&#8221;</p>

<p>She saw that his lips were white and that his face
was drawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mayn&#8217;t it be just a mere accident?&#8221; Courage was
needed to say anything. To say that called for much.</p>

<p>He laughed harshly. The gay irresponsible boy
might never have been. &#8220;Accidents don&#8217;t happen to
the Universal Press.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;But why shouldn&#8217;t they&mdash;once in a while?&#8221; Her
voice had a maternal caress in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The U. P. is the most efficient machine ever invented.
It lives for and by efficiency&mdash;damnable word!
That&#8217;s the talisman with which it sways five
continents. God help us all! No accident here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you really be sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Internal evidence. The few casual, cut-and-dried
phrases I used, hardly more than a formal returning
of thanks, have been so twisted round that they are
the exact opposite of what was meant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps there&#8217;s been a confusion of names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no! Much too circumstantial&mdash;John
Endor&mdash;luncheon&mdash;this afternoon&mdash;Blackhampton Town Hall.
There&#8217;s no excuse. And the trick is so simple, so
easy, once you condescend to its use. Take that final
phrase, &#8216;I believe in the Sword.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen waited eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Knock out the first letter of the last word and you
have the phrase I used.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was blinded for a moment by the flood of light
let in by this concrete instance. It went far to prove
that his suspicions, which by nature he was the last
man in the world to harbor, were not without warrant.
Such a rebuttal of the charge against himself was complete,
final; at the same time Helen Sholto had a very
strong reason of her own for declining to accept all
the implications that now arose.</p>

<p>In a sense she herself was an employee of the Universal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Press. For nearly two years she had been one
of the private secretaries of Saul Hartz, the master
spirit of the U. P.&mdash;its organizer of victory. Moreover
to the Colossus, as he was playfully called, she had
a deep sense of loyalty. To her he had always seemed
a truly great man. Moving up and down the intensive
London world, it was no new thing to hear harshly
criticized the mighty organization of international
newspapers of which he was the head. More than once she
had heard its motives impugned, but she had shrewdly
perceived that so great a force in the life of the time
could be wielded only at a price. To Helen Sholto
the Colossus stood forth the <i>beau id&eacute;al</i> of a considerate,
almost princely, employer. His foes were many, but
none denied his genius. And in the sight of Helen he
was so considerable a man, the admiration he excited
was so keen, her sense of gratitude was so lively and
so deep, that it was almost <i>l&egrave;se majest&eacute;</i> to traverse his
political acts.</p>

<p>It had always been the aim of the Colossus to keep
as much as possible in the background of affairs. None
the less, in his own despite, he was becoming known
as the secret power which propelled many a great movement
of the time. It was said that he created and directed
public opinion on more than one continent&mdash;to
such an extent that he made and unmade governments;
enforced and canceled treaties; in a word, he and the
International Newspaper Ring that he controlled had
become a menace to the world. But Helen Sholto in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
all her dealings with this man had never had reason
to suspect that he claimed for himself these plenary
powers.</p>

<p>Sensitive as she was for John Endor and jealous
for his growing reputation, it now became her clear
duty to defend Saul Hartz. She believed him to be
an honest man. Had one doubt infected her mind she
could not have served him. But in the immediate presence
of her fianc&eacute;&#8217;s terrible indictment she lost the
power to marshal her ideas. Womanlike she grew a
little wounded by such a condemnation of the Colossus
and all his works.</p>

<p>Granted that the blow had shaken John to the foundations
and making allowance for a vivid temperament,
she could have wished in this tragic hour that the sufferer
had shown a little more regard for her feelings.
But she had only to exhibit those feelings, or as much
of them as pride would allow, for this impulsive child-of-a-man
to be on his knees.</p>

<p>Humbly he owned that his sense of outrage had carried
him completely away. He should have remembered
that Mr. Hartz was her patron and friend. A
na&iuml;f, almost boyish apology, bound her wound, wiped
away her tears. His outburst was freely forgiven.
Perhaps it was forgiven the more freely inasmuch as
Helen felt quite sure in her own mind that she would
soon be able to clear one hero of the charges brought
against him by the other.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &#8217;LL ring up the office at once.&#8221; Helen rose impulsively.
&#8220;They must know what a dreadful
blunder the U. P. reporter has made. I&#8217;ll get
through if I can to Mr. Gage, the editor, and tell him
that on no account must the <i>Planet</i> come out with the
speech in that form. I&#8217;ll also get through to Mr. Jevons,
the chief editor of the U. P., and ask him to lose no
time in withdrawing their version, and circulating an
absolute contradiction. And as soon as I see the Chief
himself, which should be to-morrow morning at eleven
o&#8217;clock, I&#8217;ll ask him personally to do what he can to
put things right.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Endor pressed her hand. It was more than
homage to the woman he loved, it was a tribute, almost
involuntary, to her decision, her fine capacity,
her clear good sense. Of the Colossus it had been said
that his fairy godmother had given him a rare faculty
of choosing the heaven-sent instrument. Even in the
sight of John Endor this able woman had never shone
quite so much as in this crisis.</p>

<p>Forsaking a favorite iced pudding and hot chocolate
sauce, she went there and then to the telephone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
box. Endor, alone at the table, sat a picture of dismay.
He had a full share of the egoism inseparable
from a man who believes intensely in himself. It was
his sense of election that lay at the root of his power.
He was an elemental besides; his mind was a thing of
wide curves, moving on broad lines of right and wrong.
For one in essence so primitive, it would have been
hard to exaggerate the force of the blow.</p>

<p>The enemy was out in the open at last. Sitting there
in a thrall of sudden darkness, that was his thought.
The Colossus to whom in the spirit of Sir Galahad
he had offered battle was known as a deadly and a
subtle foe. To such an extent had he centralized
power, so absolute was his control of the wires, to such
perfection had he brought his &#8220;stunts,&#8221; his &#8220;propaganda,&#8221;
and all the rest of the paraphernalia, which so
easily fouled public opinion at its source, that it was
said that he could kill a reputation as easily as he could
make one.</p>

<p>For some little time past, Endor had suspected that
he was on the &#8220;Index.&#8221; More than once had he challenged
the <i>bona fides</i> of the U. P.; more than once
had he thrown down the gage to the all-powerful
newspaper ring which was now proposing to link up
every continent. Moreover, in the phrase of a recent
speech, he had bitterly attacked &#8220;its <i>Vehmgericht</i> of
assassins.&#8221; That speech, made to Helen&#8217;s dismay, and
of which she was far from realizing the true significance,
would not, he knew, be forgiven. Nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
wounds like the truth. To Helen, however, it was
part of his &#8220;platform,&#8221; an amusingly, over-emphasized
article of political faith. She did not know, she could
not be expected to know, that it was a deliberate offering
of battle to the most potent evil in the life of the
time. It was David <i>vs.</i> Goliath. The primitive sling
and pebbles had hardly a chance, but David was upheld
by the divine courage of youth and by a pure cause.</p>

<p>Already he was in the arena. He could feel the
horrid breath of the monster on his face. One flick
he had had of a grisly paw, just one little flick below
the belt&mdash;there were no Queensberry rules for the
U. P.&mdash;and he was nearly out. He was nearly out
even before the game had really started.</p>

<p>Gasping in an agony that seemed hardly less than
mortal, he realized now the nature of the odds. The
force of that first playful little tap had almost killed him.
However, he must rise from the tan. If he didn&#8217;t
look out, those cloven hoofs would be pressing out his
life.</p>

<p>There was no time to rest, even for a little while.
Let him get up, keep going somehow. He must fight
on.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">HELEN was at the telephone a long ten minutes.
She returned to find her guest in a kind of stupor.
His legs were stretched out; his eyes shut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a tiring day he must have had, poor darling!&#8221;
was her thought, as her strong, cheerful, assured voice
brought him back with a start to the moment&#8217;s pressure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I managed to get through to the Office,&#8221; she said,
sitting down again to the table. &#8220;Mr. Gage, unfortunately,
was not there. And, really&#8221;&mdash;a clear note
of vexation began to strike through the optimism this
woman of the world imposed habitually upon herself&mdash;&#8220;sometimes
they can be very trying, even in Cosmos
Alley. I explained what the situation was&mdash;told them
just what had happened&mdash;gave them your word that
the U. P. version was hopelessly inaccurate, and that
on no account must it appear in to-morrow&#8217;s <i>Planet</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; he said, faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Sub-Editor Wingrove, hidebound little
pedant&#8221;&mdash;the note of vexation was growing more dominant&mdash;&#8220;said
he could not take any responsibility in
the matter, but as soon as Mr. Gage arrived he would
lay the facts before him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;Were you able to find out whether it is their intention
to reprint the speech as given in the <i>Evening
Press</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, of course, is what I tried to do. I put the
question, point blank. But I couldn&#8217;t get anything
definite. The fact is I don&#8217;t think Mr. Wingrove
knew, but a sub-editor is like a policeman, he&#8217;ll never
own a limit to his knowledge. He hummed and hawed
and grew very Planeto-pontifico, the little donkey.
However, I clinched the matter finally by making him
promise to ring me up as soon as Mr. Gage came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What time is he expected?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a rule, he looks in at the Office between ten and
eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When does the paper go to press?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About midnight&mdash;the first edition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor looked at his watch. &#8220;Only five minutes to
nine at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s any amount of time.&#8221; The note of reassurance
was very stimulating. &#8220;And if we can&#8217;t get
something definite out of them in the course of the next
two hours, I&#8217;ll go down to the office and see Mr. Gage
myself. Now, let me get you some coffee and a little
of the Club brandy&mdash;if you&#8217;ll condescend to it&mdash;and
then I&#8217;ll see what can be done with the U. P.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, please, finish your dinner before you do
anything further.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a moment to lose with the U. P.,&#8221; she
said decisively. &#8220;I tried to get through five minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
ago, but the line was engaged. The provincial <i>Mercury</i>
goes to press at eleven, and they may raise all sorts of
difficulties. After Mr. Sub-Editor Wingrove, one
foresees big trouble in Universe Lane. However, the
<i>Mercury</i> isn&#8217;t the <i>Planet</i>. All the same, the U. P. is
the U. P., and every moment counts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she left the table, in spite of all that Endor
could do to detain her, gave orders to a servant, and
returned at once to the telephone box. Half stunned
as Endor still was by the enemy&#8217;s first blow, he had
never admired this woman&#8217;s virile sense so much.
What a prize he had won! As the thought came to
him now, it was balm for a deep wound. Quite apart
from her attraction and her charm such courage and
such competence were beyond price to a public man.</p>

<p>Close upon that reflection came one less happy. This
rare woman belonged to the enemy&#8217;s camp. It was so
like the Colossus to have this fine instrument under his
hand. Therein lay one of the secrets of his power.
And what could be clearer evidence of his Machiavellian
quality? How artful the mask he had contrived
for his purposes, when even the feminine intuitions of
a Helen Sholto were so much at fault that she could
bring herself blindly to serve him! To her Saul Hartz
was not merely an honest man, he was a hero, a
demigod.</p>

<p>By the time he had drunk some coffee, and sipped a
little brandy, he began to feel more himself. Better
able to look the situation in the face, if not to grapple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
with it, he began mentally to recite his secret formula.
<i>The gods approve the depth, and not the tumult of the
soul.</i> Never had this incantation been known to fail.
More than once, even as a boy, it had enabled him to
hitch his poor, at times half crazy, wagon to a star.</p>

<p>It did so now. When Helen returned to the room
which the other diners had already forsaken, she found
him calm. Her ten minutes&#8217; absence had wrought in
him a palpable change for the better.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some pow-wow with the U. P.&#8221; Her laugh was
light, but it could not quite conceal a powerful undercurrent
of annoyance. &#8220;Mr. Fuller himself! Up till
now, one has always had a high respect for his intelligence,
but really he can be crass!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To order&mdash;no doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said quickly, &#8220;believe me, there is not
the slightest reason to think that.&#8221; He was forced to
admire a loyalty that would admit no breath of innuendo.
&#8220;I am convinced it is no more than the red
tape of the high official. The truth is, of course, they
are all terribly afraid of the Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easily understandable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most unluckily in this case, they simply decline to
act without his explicit orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! They take it upon themselves to publish
a speech that has never been made. And they know,
of course, that I have to speak to-morrow at Hellington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I told them all that. But the rule of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
office forbids their canceling a special wire&mdash;unless they
have Mr. Hartz&#8217;s own authority to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite!&#8221; The voice of Endor grew grim. &#8220;And
they don&#8217;t need to be told that it may be absolutely
impossible to get that authority by eleven o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. I made a strong point of that. Finally,
I got Mr. Fuller&#8217;s promise to keep your speech off
the machines until a quarter to twelve. That is the
very latest moment he can allow. But at least it gives
us a little more time in which to do something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray, what can one do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must get through at once to the Chief himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Hartz?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, to the mountain! Miss Mahomet is now going
to ring up Carlton House Terrace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Endor could interpose any real effort to hold
her back, she was off again to the telephone.</p>

<p>The Club brandy continued to soothe his fretted
nerves, but the calmer he grew, the higher his conviction
mounted that the plot was deep laid, and that one
woman, of no matter what will or what capacity, would
not be allowed to undo it. All the same, it would be
instructive to see how the game was played. The predestined
victim could take at least a morbid zest in
observing the workings of &#8220;the machine.&#8221; It had
hardly started to move as yet, but all too soon his head
would be in the basket.</p>

<p>Helen was back this time in three minutes. She
looked decidedly crestfallen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;Such bad luck! Of course, one guessed he&#8217;d be
dining out. But they don&#8217;t know where. At one of
his clubs, they think, and he may have gone on to the
opera. Still, they can&#8217;t say. They only know that
he may return at any time from now on until after
midnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor smiled rather sadly. &#8220;Never mind. Let us
accept the omen. There can be no contending with
Destiny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; she said bravely, fighting his
fatalism, &#8220;I have fully made up my mind to hunt down
the Chief in the next two hours&mdash;wherever he is to be
found. Only he can stop the <i>Planet</i> and the U. P.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may decline to do so&mdash;even if you run him to
earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why in the world should you think that?&#8221; Her
voice was full of challenge. &#8220;An honest man is bound&mdash;is
simply bound&mdash;to stop them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree,&#8221; said Endor, abstractedly. &#8220;I humbly beg
the pardon of the Colossus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please beg mine&mdash;for thinking&mdash;thinking&mdash;thinking!&#8221;</p>

<p>He kissed her hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m hardly myself to-night,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had a really tiresome day,&#8221; she said, gently;
&#8220;what with a journey to Blackhampton and back again&mdash;not
to mention the luncheon, the presentation, and
now this horrid affair! You look quite worn out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Recognizing that he must pull himself together, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
proceeded rather heroically to do so. He was upheld,
moreover, by Helen&#8217;s strength of purpose, the working
of her active will, of her high and keen intelligence.
And yet, at the back of everything, he felt that all they
did would be futile. This was only a beginning, the
first turn of the wheel. Now that a cog had caught
him, the devil&#8217;s work would go on until his life had
been crushed out. But she could not be expected to
know that. And in this early phase he ought not to
make any such admission, even to himself. It was
weak. No matter what happened he must go down
fighting.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s on to-night at the opera?&#8221; said Helen.
Under her chair lay the discarded <i>Evening Press</i>. She
picked it up. &#8220;The Russian ballet. He is quite likely
to be there. If he is, he may not be home before midnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment she considered the question in its
various aspects. And then she said, &#8220;I&#8217;d better go
there and see if I can find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor shook his head. &#8220;Looking,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for a
pin in a truss of hay to search for people at the opera.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a box. More than once he&#8217;s lent it to me.
If he&#8217;s there, I&#8217;ll find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A growing sense of the futility of all they could do
was now overpowering Endor. But he was forced to
admire the noble zeal which was determined not to
leave one thing undone.</p>

<p>Knowing argument to be vain, he was content merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
to insist upon the finishing of the meal before she did
anything else. But it was only under protest that she
could be brought to do even that. If Mr. Hartz was
not at the opera, the sooner they learned that fact the
better.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ENDOR, against his private judgment and the will
of Helen, accompanied her to Covent Garden.
She was sure that after such a day he ought to go
straight to bed. Curiously temperamental, she knew
him to be, but never had she seen him so completely
&#8220;bowled out.&#8221; Like all people who live on their
nerves, he was poised on a very fine thread; yet this
threat of collapse was hardly justified by the thing that
had occurred. He saw in it more than the facts seemed
on the surface to warrant. She, on the contrary, was
sure that a word from the Chief would put the whole
thing right.</p>

<p>It was ten o&#8217;clock when they reached Covent Garden.
Helen, by dint of tact amounting to diplomacy which
she brought to bear on divers officials, was able at last
to send one of them with an urgent message to Mr.
Hartz&#8217;s box. Soon, however, the answer came that
Mr. Hartz was not there, and that to the best of the
messenger&#8217;s information he had not been there that
evening.</p>

<p>A rebuff, for which Helen was half prepared, left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
her undaunted. They turned down the street to Universe
Lane, on the off-chance that the <i>Mercury</i> might
be able to throw light on the whereabouts of the great
man. This the <i>Mercury</i> could not do; nor was the
Office itself in the adjacent Cosmos Alley able to provide
a clue to the movements of the august controller
of the U. P.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll now draw his clubs,&#8221; said Helen, undefeatedly.
&#8220;He may be at the Game in Piccadilly playing
bridge. Or he may be in Pall Mall smoking a quiet
cigar at the Imperium.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both, alas! were drawn blank. The Colossus was
not nor had been that evening at either. &#8220;Dead out
of luck, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;It&#8217;s very vexing.&#8221;</p>

<p>One other course only occurred to her now. That
was to go on to Carlton House Terrace, and if Mr.
Hartz had not returned home to await his arrival.
They went there accordingly only to learn that he had
not yet come in; moreover, so uncertain, as a rule,
were his nocturnal movements that the butler did not
care to commit himself as to the hour his master was
likely to do so. &#8220;May be here any moment, miss, or he
may even not be here at&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The butler&#8217;s discretion
did not allow him to complete his sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll wait for him,&#8221; said Helen, with an air
of quiet decision, &#8220;for an hour, at any rate.&#8221; She
glanced at a watch on her wrist. &#8220;Nearly eleven already.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went down the steps to the taxi and John Endor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
To him she made her intention known. &#8220;And you,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;must go straight home to bed. You are
fagged out. Now mind you don&#8217;t worry about this.
A word from the Chief will clear up everything. Forget
it all. Promise me you will. And for my part I
promise that it shall be put right. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how will you get home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My tube to South Kensington runs till one o&#8217;clock.
And I&#8217;m quite used to being out late. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling!&#8221; he whispered, hoarsely. &#8220;You darling!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood a moment by the curb to watch him drive
away.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS Helen was shown into Saul Hartz&#8217;s library a
clock on the chimneypiece struck eleven.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I get you anything, miss?&#8221; said the butler,
to whom she was well known.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Jennings&mdash;no.&#8221; She shivered slightly;
it was a chill September night.</p>

<p>Jennings gave the fire a poke and retired.</p>

<p>Helen took a book from a table, turned up a reading
lamp and sat down. At first so strong was the
current of her thought that she did not look at the
book. Her whole mind was fixed upon the forty
precious minutes that could be allowed for Mr. Hartz&#8217;s
return. If he tarried beyond that time it might be too
late for him to be of use&mdash;at any rate, so far as the
U. P. was concerned. In regard to the <i>Planet</i> he
might, perhaps, be allowed another two hours.</p>

<p>Severe good sense forbade giving her thoughts much
rein. Worry was not going to help. Besides, she had
one of those disciplined minds, which, in spite of the
moment&#8217;s pressure, are not allowed to riot. She looked
at the book in her hand. Its title was <i>Essays in Contribution
to a Permanent Peace</i>, its author, John Endor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Publication was not due for another fortnight, but an
advance copy had been sent already to the <i>Planet</i> by the
book&#8217;s publishers in the hope of an early review.</p>

<p>Coincidence, brain wave, sixth, seventh, eighth,
nth sense, had drawn her fingers subconsciously,
in semidarkness to this volume. That it was
now in her hand was not due to the fact that she had
read the title on the cover. The book&#8217;s coming open
at this particular place was less a fruit of chance than
of the fact that a marker had been inserted.</p>

<p>A mere glance disclosed that much of page 204 was
heavily underscored in red ink.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The most acute problem of this vexed time is the
ever-growing power of the newspaper press. Legislation
of a drastic kind is needed to cope with certain
newspaper &#8216;bosses&#8217; in Great Britain and America and
their combinations, national and international, of
periodicals, agencies, special correspondents and their
sinister antennae, which persistently foul at the source
the wells of truth. So long as the infernal machinery
which creates and molds public opinion and now aspires
to govern the world can be set in motion by the
Luciferian minds which control it, minds whose sole
merit is a prodigious development of the modern business
brain and its infinite capacity for combination and
adjustment, hope of a stable peace on any of the five
continents of this unlucky planet is out of the question.
It cannot be said too often that such an engine as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Universal Press is a power for evil and a dire menace
to civilization.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>To the eyes that read these words they were written
in letters of fire. They seemed to burn themselves
in Helen&#8217;s brain. Could this terrible indictment
be true? Was it justified? At least it was the considered
verdict of the man she had promised to marry.
And it was directed against one who had her whole
allegiance, one who crowned with a princely reward
her loyal labors.</p>

<p>The Chief had many foes. So much was known to
her. But like most other people she had been willing
to regard that fact as a tribute to the peculiar nature of
his talent. Saul Hartz&#8217;s enemies were the first to own
that his genius had enabled him to get so many strings
into his hand that he was able to interfere too intimately
with the inner workings of the body politic.
He had made such a &#8220;corner&#8221; in public opinion and
the subterranean forces which mold it that he had
been able to upset the true balance of government
throughout the world. Acute minds saw the time coming
when the U. P. would have all nations at its mercy.</p>

<p>Helen Sholto knew that sinister charges had been
brought against a portentous machine. But to
her they had always remained vague. Now, however,
they were taking shape. Once she had heard
Mr. Hartz stigmatize John Endor as a fanatic. The
moment was at hand when the two men must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
weighed in the scales. Which was in the right?
Helen felt that her whole career was involved in the
answer about to be given.</p>

<p>Under which king, Bezonian? The words seemed
to come to her out of the upper air. It was as if they
sounded in the delicate ear of her spirit. Before, however,
she could trace them to their source she was terribly
startled. Someone had entered the room unperceived.
With a shiver she woke to a perception of the
fact that the Colossus stood looking at her.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was something almost feline in the movements
of Saul Hartz. So cat-footed was his progress
about the Office that he was continually taking
his staff by surprise. It made for efficiency, no doubt,
this liability to be overlooked and incidentally &#8220;to be
fired&#8221; at short notice; but in the opinion of the more
Olympian spirits who lived under his &aelig;gis such tactics
were hardly worthy of one so august. They were content
to suffer them all the same. Saul Hartz in everything
insisted on being a law unto himself.</p>

<p>He was very much a law unto himself to-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221; So like the man to get
through at once, without preface or apology, to a leading
question. The book, at that moment, was the one
thing that mattered to the Colossus. &#8220;Bright fellow
that?&#8221; He did not disdain to answer his own question;
it was his method, as a rule, of asking another. &#8220;But!&#8221;
He tapped a finger of rue, half humorous, half melodramatic
upon the center of an immense forehead, &#8220;just a
weeny!&#8221; As he drummed again an odd puckering
of the eyelids somehow became truly comic. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry to have to say so.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>Helen rose rather nervously from her chair. She
was never quite at her ease in this man&#8217;s presence.
Few were. Before she could muster wits enough to
say anything, Saul Hartz had gone on developing his
theme in the hushed, far-away voice which only one
person at a time was ever able to hear and yet in the
ear of that person every syllable was like a bell. &#8220;Madness
in the mother&#8217;s family. Got his <i>dossier</i>&mdash;dear
fellow! Brilliant at Oxford. At Eton, too. Geared
a little too high, just a little too high&mdash;that&#8217;s all. Great
pity! A second Gladstone might have been so useful
just now. But&#8221;&mdash;the shrug of the Colossus almost
seemed in the tranced eyes of Helen to set the cosmos
whirling&mdash;&#8220;over the verge already. Dear fellow!&#8221;</p>

<p>The finality of that gentle, rather eerie voice turned
her soul faint. She could not repress a shudder. The
sense of fate as adumbrated in the personality of this
man was overpowering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear fellow!&#8221; He developed his theme with a
cadence ever-recurring, yet of a slightly fantastic irrelevance,
like a <i>leit-motif</i> of the later Wagner.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen his speech, I daresay, to his constituents.
Proud people&mdash;they must be&mdash;dear fellow! Mother,
you know, was one of the mad Dinneford lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>So intense was his absorption in his subject that it
might be said to evoke an atmosphere. The room itself
became submerged in a miasma that was almost
deadly. Helen had a sensation of being stifled by a
lurking, unknown force. It was very difficult to interpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
a word. By the time she was able to do so, mischief
had been wrought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you wonder why I&#8217;m here,&#8221; she said, &#8220;at this
hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To own the <i>Planet</i>,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;is to wonder at
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want your help in a matter of great importance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; There came at once an entire change of
tone and manner that was charming. &#8220;Sit down again
in that chair, and tell me just precisely what I can do.&#8221;
Of a sudden he had put on the cloak of an indulgent
father. When he spoke like that to any one, there
was no resisting him.</p>

<p>Helen automatically obeyed. &#8220;It&#8217;s about Mr. Endor&#8217;s
speech.&#8221; She plunged in <i>medias res</i>. With
those eyes, their light ever changing, fixed upon her,
she lost the power to order her words artistically.
&#8220;I have his assurance that he has been misreported.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; The slight exclamation was curiously, almost
affectionately, gentle.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s so upset!&#8221; A feminine urgency of tone was
the oddest contrast. &#8220;Almost every word he used
has in some strange way been given another meaning.
For instance, the final phrase as given in the <i>Evening
Press</i> is &#8216;I believe in the Sword.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I noticed that.&#8221; The tone had all the kindliness
of an old-fashioned pedagogue patting on the
head a favorite pupil. &#8220;A little bold perhaps just now,
but striking ... really quite striking!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;But it was never used. What he did say was, &#8216;I
believe in the Word.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;the &#8216;Word&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;I believe in the Word.&#8217; Quite
so. Hardly so effective. Everybody has believed in
the &#8216;Word&#8217; since the time of Moses. But the &#8216;sword,&#8217;
it takes a big man just now&mdash;just at the moment&mdash;to
believe in the sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t believe in it, that&#8217;s the whole point.&#8221;
Helen&#8217;s voice grew a little strained. &#8220;It&#8217;s a mistake,
just a ghastly mistake. On no account, he says, must
the speech be circulated. It will do so much harm, not
only in this country, but in America, where he has so
many friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So many friends in America. How interesting!&#8221;
Again the head of the good boy received a gentle,
fatherly pat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see&mdash;that a speech like that&mdash;may undo
a reputation&mdash;a reputation that it has taken years&mdash;years&mdash;to
build up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221; The soul of a courtier was in the
throbbing warmth of that faint whisper. &#8220;Well, you
are always right.&#8221; What in the mouth of any one
else would have been a gross compliment became in that
of the Colossus a sober presentment of fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is of vital importance that the speech, at any
rate the U. P. version, shall not appear in to-morrow&#8217;s
<i>Planet</i> or <i>Mercury</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite.&#8221; Mr. Hartz nodded indulgently. &#8220;One appreciates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
that ... at least ... one appreciates his
feeling about it ... dear fellow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has an important meeting at Hellington to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite.&#8221; Again the indulgent nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the U. P. must circulate an unconditional
withdrawal to overtake as quickly as possible the harm
it has already done.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was not an instant&#8217;s hesitation. &#8220;If he wants
that, he&#8217;s entitled to have it certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s so little time,&#8221; said Helen urgently.
&#8220;It is only with the utmost difficulty that Mr. Fuller
has been persuaded to keep the provincial <i>Mercury</i> off
the machines until a quarter to twelve, in the hope of
being able to get your permission to omit the speech
altogether. There&#8217;s only five minutes now, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much may happen in five minutes at the headquarters
of the planetary bodies.&#8221; The playfulness of
the Colossus was delightful. It was also reassuring.
For it had been said of him that inside five minutes
he was fully competent to knock Saturn out of the
firmament and put it back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I your authority to stop the <i>Mercury</i>?&#8221; Her
eagerness was a little pathetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&mdash;of course.&#8221; The tone was thistledown.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I may use your telephone&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She was on her
feet, the woman of action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, please, and go on reading his clever book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
while I myself speak a little word to the Office. These
rubs will arise, don&#8217;t you know, in the best regulated
families, as Lucifer, Son of the Morning, is said to
have remarked on a much-celebrated occasion to President
Wilson.&#8221; With the air of a very kindly, rather
boyish, old gentleman having a game of romps with
a favorite grandchild, he forced her back to her chair
and her book. And then with a kind of elephantine
humor he made for the door.</p>

<p>At its threshold, with a hearty laugh, he turned
again. &#8220;The revised version of this priceless old-world
story is that it was Mr. President who really
made the remark to the Eldest of the Sons of Time
in old John Milton&#8217;s&mdash;or was it old John Morley&#8217;s?&mdash;hearing.
However, the point is not material at the
moment. A little word with the Office.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the pleasant chuckle of one basking agreeably
in the light of his own humor, he went out of the room.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">IX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the door closed, Helen began to feel that
she could breathe again. The room was large,
high-ceiled, well-ventilated; but the Colossus had
seemed to absorb every molecule of air there was in it.
In this mood of expansion he was truly formidable.
No matter what his detractors had to say of him, and
they said much and said it bitterly, it was never denied
that Saul Hartz was a power.</p>

<p>As soon as the door had closed, however, Helen
for the first time in a two years&#8217; intercourse, brought
herself to shape a question. Was it really wise to trust
this man so blindly? Where there was so much smoke
must there not be also a certain amount of fire?</p>

<p>Encompassed by that dynamic force the higher nerve-centers
were a little apt to fail. And to submit the
all-embracing mind of Saul Hartz to the common scale
of right and wrong was hardly feasible. Right and
wrong in that paradoxical cosmos of a brain, which
yet formed a key to the whole objective modern world,
seemed interchangeable terms. She recalled hearing
him say more than once, that Right in the midday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
special was Wrong in the evening edition. Certainly
he made a jest of everything. He seemed to believe in
nothing, to respect nobody; yet in her dealings with the
man himself she had always found him scrupulously
kind, wonderfully considerate, nobly generous.</p>

<p>To-night, in this chance visit, she had never felt so
much out of her depth, she had never been swept so
completely off her feet. John Endor was no common
man, but this Chief to whom she owed allegiance had
somehow a quality which seemed to raise him almost
beyond good and evil.</p>

<p>In a time which to Helen was unexpectedly brief,
Mr. Hartz was back in the room. &#8220;So much for that,&#8221;
he said with the light, casual air that was always
charming.</p>

<p>Helen rose at once. &#8220;Ever so many thanks,&#8221; she
said, wholeheartedly. &#8220;I was quite sure it had only
to be mentioned.&#8221; A look of gratitude drove the words
right home. &#8220;And now I must fly. Good-night&mdash;and
again, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The passage to the door, however, was barred, playfully,
if resolutely, by the genial spread of the Colossus:
&#8220;Now please don&#8217;t run away. Sit down and tell me a
little about yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the last train from Piccadilly Circus to
think of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t twelve yet. The South Kensington tube is
open till one o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was flattering to think that so great a man should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
carry in his mind her address, but it was like him not
to forget the simplest of facts. &#8220;Besides, I take all
responsibility for getting you home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And accept it, I hope&#8221;&mdash;yielding with a laugh&mdash;&#8220;if
I am late to-morrow at the Office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me get you a cup of tea or something.&#8221; He
pressed a bell. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have a whisky and soda
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen declined refreshment.</p>

<p>To the servant who entered Mr. Hartz said: &#8220;Please
tell Jennings the brougham will be wanted in half an
hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duly armed with a &#8220;nightcap&#8221; which contained a
great deal more soda than whisky the Colossus sat
cosily down by the fire immediately opposite Helen.
A man of fifty-two, his manner towards this singularly
attractive woman of six-and-twenty was so whimsically,
yet frankly, paternal, that something beyond
disparity of years seemed necessary to sustain it.</p>

<p>An odd sensation, unlike anything she had ever
felt before, came subtly upon Helen. This man&#8217;s personality
was geared very high, but unlike that of John
Endor it seemed to be a fixed quantity, not liable to
fluctuate. In his case the nerves didn&#8217;t show. To
talk to, when he chose, he was delightful. Just now,
perhaps half deliberately, he chose.</p>

<p>If the question was not impertinent, why was she
concerned so particularly for John Endor&#8217;s reputation?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Her shrewdness had allowed her to foresee that such
a question might arise. She was half prepared to
answer it. As the necessity came, however, she yielded
to a slight embarrassment which did not make her
attraction less.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to be married.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saul Hartz gave a sharp upthrow of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky fellow!&#8221; The words of the Colossus were
almost as quick as thought itself. &#8220;Devilish lucky
fellow! I <i>do</i> congratulate him&mdash;upon my word!&#8221;
The purr of the gentle voice had a warmth of overtone
that in the ear of Helen was delicious. She felt
the blood pass over her cheeks in a wave. Such a
voice as that must have opened the heart of any woman.
He had the power, when he chose, of simulating an intense
humanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you congratulate me?&#8221; she ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course&mdash;of course.&#8221; The purr had not
changed and yet, in a way that almost impinged on
the mysteries of counterpoint, she was made to guess
rather than to feel that a vital something was no longer
there.</p>

<p><i>Madness in the mother&#8217;s family.</i> Those five words
descended upon her from the upper air. Almost in
the same instant the open book on her knee slid to the
carpet.</p>

<p>She had not time to recover the book before Mr.
Hartz was on his feet politely restoring it to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clever, you know.&#8221; He seemed to think aloud.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
&#8220;A mind at work there.&#8221; The book was placed loverly
in her hand. &#8220;Only one hopes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Sighing delicately he returned to his chair. His air
had now become that of one who has to reconcile a
very good heart with the sterner impulses of duty.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hope?&#8221; She caught up the broken phrase
with an eagerness that was a little pitiful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shivered slightly. <i>Madness in the mother&#8217;s
family.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful faculty he has&#8221;&mdash;the Colossus seemed
again to be thinking aloud&mdash;&#8220;of swaying audiences.
Rather picked audiences, too. And as men are reckoned
nowadays, hardly more than a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s thirty-eight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost an infant prodigy!&#8221; The deep laugh was
very good to hear. &#8220;I never heard Gladstone. Before
my day. But one or two of the fathers who go back
to prehistoric times say that your young man is such
another, but that the People&#8217;s John&mdash;proud title the
People&#8217;s John&mdash;and only thirty-eight&mdash;has one shot in
his game that the G. O. M. never had. It&#8217;s the master-shot,
too, believe me. Humor. Cool-drawn humor.
With that in your bag, you&#8217;ve always a chance of holing
out under bogey. Don&#8217;t you agree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I hope he has it,&#8221; said the cautious Helen.
&#8220;But whether on the platform it quite &#8216;gets over,&#8217; as
they say in the theater, one is never quite sure. Whenever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
one hears him one is always dominated by his
tremendous moral enthusiasm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s your Gladstone. Always <i>the</i> card, of
course. That&#8217;s why good judges think he may go a
very long way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen&#8217;s heart took fire. These were big words in
the mouth of the Colossus. &#8220;You think that?&#8221; She
looked eagerly across at him. &#8220;Really and truly you
think that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The immediate answer of the great man was slowly
to produce a cigar case. &#8220;No use offering you a
cigarette. I know you don&#8217;t smoke. Wise&mdash;very
wise woman.&#8221; As he spoke he chose a cigar, cut off
the end, lit it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think he&#8217;ll go far?&#8221; she persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pundits seem pretty unanimous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&mdash;yourself&mdash;personally?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colossus drew tentatively at his cigar. &#8220;Pray,
who am I&mdash;a mere newspaper man&mdash;to hold an opinion&mdash;on
such a matter? I can only tell you that Mr. Ransom
thinks so and he, as you know, held office before
the Deluge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&mdash;yourself?&#8221; She was determined to nail
him down. &#8220;Do you think John Endor may one day
be Prime Minister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, since you ask me&#8221;&mdash;each word was like a
drip of ice-cold water&mdash;&#8220;in my humble opinion, I
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in the deliberate voice clutched her by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
the throat. As his eye caught hers and held it,
she drew her breath quickly in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you ask me.&#8221; The tone was sweet apology,
&#8220;Only my poor opinion. Really, I don&#8217;t pretend to
know. Why should one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;that ... he ... might...?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, I think nothing.&#8221; It was the father speaking
again. &#8220;One can&#8217;t help feeling he&#8217;s a rather high
explosive, that&#8217;s all. And of course, the mother&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The mother!&#8221; Her breath came and went in a
little gasp.</p>

<p>Watching her closely he saw her turn very white.
&#8220;I beg your pardon!&#8221; He was very quick, very adroit.
&#8220;But you pin me down. And you mean so much to
one, you know. In the Office we have come quite to
depend on you. I can&#8217;t help thinking of you almost
as a girl of my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>The simple words sank deep. They were music.
This man had always had her loyal admiration. And
now, as she sat facing him, she began to feel awed by a
sense of all that he had done for her.</p>

<p>Suddenly a picture was flashed before her mind.
Far away in America, in a backwater of a southern
state, she saw her old parents hard pressed by modern
conditions, but whose lot for nearly two years now she
had been able to lighten with a liberal slice from her
salary. It was going to be a terrible wrench to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
up her life at the Office. And then John himself,
would he, could he...?</p>

<p>The man who sat opposite seemed to read every
thought she had.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly a matter upon which one is entitled to
speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father again. &#8220;But, as I say, you mean so much
to us in the Office&mdash;so please&mdash;please look before and
after.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sense of being overcome by a great spirit afflicted
her now. Here was an infinite power. She felt her
defenses giving. The walls of the large room were beginning
to press upon her. She was alone with the
man in his own house, it was after midnight, she was
at his mercy. Such fear was unworthy, but she was
seized by a fierce desire to escape. There was the
unknown to reckon with. At its beck, and under its
fires, even her most sacred instincts were in danger of
being subverted.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">NEXT morning, as the clock struck eleven, the
Chief entered his private room at the Office.</p>

<p>Punctuality, said his many biographers, was a cardinal
fact in an amazing life. But Saul Hartz knew
better.</p>

<p>As the Colossus sat down at his table, the mere look
of him would have been enough to repute any theory
so prosaic. The key of personality lay deeper. It
was to be found in the eyes, curiously hooded like
those of a bird of prey. In those undisclosed depths
lurked the faculty of seeing into the future.</p>

<p>It was this rather terrible power that had made
Saul Hartz the thing he was. He could afford to
smile at the array of mental and moral virtues his Lives
insisted upon. Well he knew how completely they
were transcended by the fact that his birth had been
attended by a Fairy.</p>

<p>A tray set on his blotting pad contained a mail of
thirty unopened but judiciously sorted letters. He
turned over each one in turn. In several cases the
back of the envelope told all he needed to know about
them. Others aroused a languid interest, a mild curiosity;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
life had few thrills to offer Saul Hartz. Two
letters, however, among the pile were able to fix his
attention. One had ultra thick paper embossed with
the monogram of Royalty; the other was a black-sealed,
black-edged envelope, registered and marked &#8220;private.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somehow, the mere look of the second letter intrigued
the Colossus. His manner of laying it down
proved that. But as a minor exercise in the art of
self-mastery&mdash;it amused him to play these little pranks
upon himself&mdash;he placed it carefully at the bottom of
the pile. Then he opened the royal envelope.</p>

<p>A considerable personage, in his own hand, fair and
clerkly, warmly thanked &#8220;My dear Hartz&#8221; for his efforts
on behalf of the London hospitals. Previous
campaigns in the newspapers had raised great sums,
but the guiding spirit of the Universal Press was urgently
asked to open a special fund to meet the needs
of the coming winter.</p>

<p>This letter in hand, Mr. Hartz pondered rather less
than a minute, and then he pressed a bell-button fixed
in the side of his desk sharply three times.</p>

<p>The summons was answered at once by a youngish,
bald, dome-headed man who wore the serious, rather
pinched look that accompanies an intense preoccupation
with money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Mumby.&#8221; The Chief greeted cheerfully
the financial member of his Cabinet. Then he
tossed him the letter. Before Mr. Mumby, in order
to do justice to this document, could fix gold-rimmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
eyeglasses to a nose with a narrow ridge, the Colossus
gave a soft chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;A slight&mdash;a very slight irritation of the lobe of the
left ear&#8221;&mdash;while he plucked at that organ his eye was
fixed on Mr. Mumby&#8217;s face&mdash;&#8220;tells me that an irruption
of Popocatapetl is about to occur. I hope you appreciate
its significance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even Mr. Mumby, schooled as he was in the more
recondite ways of the Chief, was at a loss. The Colossus,
however, was kind enough at once to enlighten
him. &#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what is the price of National
Mexican Thirds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They closed last night,&#8221; said Mr. Mumby, who carried
all little matters of that kind in his head, &#8220;at
forty-six and an eighth, rather sellers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chief tapped an excellent set of teeth with a
black lead pencil, a favorite trick when engaged in
thinking constructively. &#8220;Suppose you go a bear&mdash;a
modest bear?&#8221; Again he plucked at his left ear, but
this time a smile famous upon five continents accompanied
the action.</p>

<p>&#8220;When shall I cover, sir?&#8221; said Mr. Mumby, impassively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve o&#8217;clock on Thursday,&#8221; said the Colossus.
&#8220;And you can start the fund of His Nibs with the
proceeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand pounds, sir?&#8221; Mr. Mumby was more
impassive than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. A thousand pounds from the proprietor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the <i>Planet</i> newspaper. That, I think, should meet the
case&mdash;to begin with, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the third time the Colossus plucked a little whimsically
at his left ear. Mr. Mumby bowed discreetly
and retired.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Chief turned again to his letters. That which
he opened next was not the one that was really going
to interest him. The place for it was still the bottom
of the pile. He felt this <i>bonne bouche</i> was going to
interest him so much that he would keep it until the
very end.</p>

<p>All the same a mild surprise was contained in the
second letter. It was an invitation for a week-end in
the country, &#8220;to meet some rather interesting people.&#8221;
Mr. Hartz permitted himself a faint smile. The socially
gifted Mrs. Carburton was a power in the land,
but emphatically she belonged to &#8220;the other camp.&#8221;
Strictly speaking, the Colossus was far too big to belong
to a camp. Mrs. Carburton did not belong to one
either; but of late years they had not set each other&#8217;s
genius. The famous ch&acirc;telaine of Doe Hill made no
secret of her belief that the U. P. had deliberately
wrought the ruin of one of her rather numerous prot&eacute;g&eacute;es.
She was known to have a deep dislike for
Saul Hartz. But she was important enough as the
world went for an invitation to Doe Hill to be not
without piquancy even for him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>Should he accept it? Why not? His attitude of
slightly contemptuous indifference towards women in
general was his attitude towards this woman, but she
was a mine of information, and she made a hobby of
gracing her table with the most interesting people in
Europe. And for those alive to the lure of sex, her
power of attraction was undoubted. Few men would
have denied that Rose Carburton was, in her way, a
siren.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartz was still in the valley of decision, this
letter in hand, when Helen Sholto came into the room.
Some two years before, on one of his brief but frequent
trips across the Atlantic, he had found this remarkably
able girl doing odd jobs in the New York
office. Taken at once by her personality, he had
brought her to London as one of several confidential
secretaries, to whom, however, he never opened his
mind; and in a post that was no sinecure she had discovered
a feminine quick-thinking competence that had
proved of high value. Moreover, Helen herself, with
her charm, her high spirits, her good looks, seemed
to relieve even the gloom and the grime of Cosmos
Alley.</p>

<p>The great man had this morning, as usual, a cordial
greeting, a benign smile, to offer her. But it hardly
called for his abnormal powers of observation to see
at once that something was wrong. His greeting was
returned with a slight bow. Her face was grave and
set. And in prompt response to the question in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
eyes, she said without a word of preface in a low voice,
&#8220;I wish to give formal notice to terminate my engagement
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saul Hartz&#8217;s answer was to drum gently with a
pencil on his blotting pad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s cruel!&#8221; Her eyes filled suddenly with
tears. &#8220;The speech is in all the papers this morning.
And the <i>Planet</i> has a leading article ... after your
promise!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colossus gazed at her impassively, and then he
said, in that peculiar soft tone that now made her
shiver. &#8220;Sit down, my dear child, and compose yourself.
There&#8217;s something I have to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Against her own reluctant will, Helen took a chair
at the side of his desk, towards which he pointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;To begin with,&#8221; he said, &#8220;let me apologize for a
mistake&mdash;a regrettable mistake. The instructions I
gave hurriedly last night over the telephone were misunderstood.
But I want you to believe&#8221;&mdash;the soft
voice was now fused with feeling&mdash;&#8220;that that mistake,
deplorable as it is, after all, is only of minor importance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen could only gasp. Of only minor importance!
How dare he say that!</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, on inquiry, we learn that the speech was
made as reported.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mr. Endor declares that he never used the
words attributed to him,&#8221; was Helen&#8217;s answer, quick
and stern.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;So I understand. But is Mr. Endor&#8217;s memory to
be trusted? that is the point. He spoke without notes;
he has no evidence of what he said impromptu, almost,
as it were, on the spur of the moment, at a champagne
luncheon. Many a man has wished to take back words,
uttered under such circumstances. You see, the difficulty
that arises in this case is&#8221;&mdash;the hooded eyes were
opening and fastening upon her&mdash;&#8220;that three members
of our staff who, by the way, were the only reporters
there, are in unanimous agreement as to the words Mr.
Endor used. They may not be the words Mr. Endor
intended to use, but that is hardly a matter for the
U. P.&#8221;</p>

<p>With those eyes fixed on her, Helen felt a chill
spread through her veins.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, my dear child,&#8221;&mdash;the father once more&mdash;&#8220;the
evidence so far as we are concerned is conclusive.
Three trusted members of the U. P. staff against one ...
shall I say ... ra ... ther ... no, no, I beg
your pardon ... I&#8217;d forgotten he&#8217;s your fianc&eacute;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night,&#8221; Helen managed to say, in spite of the
tentacles that pinned her now, &#8220;you promised to contradict
the U. P. version, and withdraw it from circulation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I did,&#8221; was the gentle answer. &#8220;But I may not
have realized ... quite adequately realized that our
version was the only one at that moment in existence.
Moreover, it places us in an awkward ... an immensely
awkward position to have to go back on our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
own people ... whom we trust implicitly. However,&#8221;&mdash;the
intense pain in her eyes did not escape
him&mdash;&#8220;a promise is a promise, even if unwisely given.
The U. P. is going to publish Mr. Endor&#8217;s disclaimer,
and if I may say so ... if I may claim so much for
it ... it is going to have the signal generosity not to
divulge the facts upon which, in my humble judgment,
it is fully entitled to rely. Indeed, having regard to
the special ... the very special circumstances,&#8221;&mdash;a
note of magnanimity was now in the voice of the
Colossus&mdash;&#8220;I give you my word that the U. P. will not
put in this very strong evidence on its own behalf
unless Mr. Endor should happen to think that an action
can lie against it. In that event, of course, I&#8217;m afraid
it will have to be a case of <i>cet animal est tr&egrave;s mechant</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What good,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;can this contradiction do
Mr. Endor now? The lie has gone round the world
and the truth can never overtake it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie is a hard word,&#8221; said the Colossus, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must believe the man who made the speech,&#8221;
Helen&#8217;s voice trembled. &#8220;I do believe him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are in a very difficult position, but you can depend
on our doing what we can to set the matter right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be too late,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;Personally, I feel
that it is. Millions who read the original report in
England and America will never see the contradiction.
A speech of that kind may take a man years to live
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221;&mdash;never had the voice of Saul Hartz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
sounded more suasive&mdash;&#8220;the U. P. must see what it
can do in a truly difficult case. And, in the meantime,
let me beg you, as much for your own sake as for
ours, not to desert the old ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>A second time Helen&#8217;s eyes filmed with tears. &#8220;I
feel,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that I can never work with you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The silence which now constrained them was broken
at last by the hushed, far-away voice which always
seemed to hypnotize her. &#8220;Have you realized what
it means? Do you quite see all that such a step involves?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mournfully she owned that never again did she expect
to earn a thousand dollars a month.</p>

<p>&#8220;And John Endor, I believe, is by no means a rich
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen believed so too. But she permitted herself
a modest hope that she might still be able to earn a
good salary.</p>

<p>&#8220;In journalism?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, my dear child,&#8221;&mdash;once more the father,&mdash;&#8220;is
a point on which it really becomes my duty to disillusion
you. If you break with us, your career in journalism
is at an end.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE words of the Colossus, spoken delicately
though they were, came to Helen like a blow over
the heart. But she had the dour courage of the born
fighter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely that remains to be seen.&#8221; For the first time
in the course of a two years&#8217; friendship with Saul
Hartz, a chord of antagonism rang in Helen&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>The Colossus paused a moment to look at her.
&#8220;True, my dear.&#8221; Of a sudden the tone had grown
almost deprecatory. &#8220;But I do want you to look before
and after. You contemplate a very serious step.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen agreed that for herself such a step must prove
serious indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;For both of us, my dear. You will be very much
missed here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was touched by this magnanimity and also flattered
by it, for she knew it to be the frank expression
of his mind. The Chief did not want to part with her,
that was clear. She had reason to think she had been
of use to him and that he had always liked her personally.
Certainly from the day of their first meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
in New York she had received exceptional kindness
and consideration at his hands.</p>

<p>As far as Saul Hartz himself was concerned, he had
known from the outset that she had first-rate abilities.
None understood better than he the value of the feminine
mind with its faculty of taking short cuts to deep
conclusions. By its intuitive &#8220;scrapping&#8221; of a thousand-and-one
considerations that are apt to fetter the
slow-moving male it was able to save time and expenditure
of spirit and yet &#8220;to get there&#8221; just the same.</p>

<p>Helen Sholto, over and beyond an exceptionally quick
perception, had now become a highly trained woman
of the modern world, a brilliant writer and speaker
who understood her own sex. Already she counted
with that important but elusive entity, the woman voter.
She had, too, powers of organization, a real capacity
for handling large affairs. Saul Hartz with his flair
in such matters saw that her combination of rare qualities
was likely to carry her far.</p>

<p>To the Colossus no one was indispensable, but in
certain ways he had come to lean rather heavily on
Helen Sholto; and he had made up his mind that she
must not be allowed to serve in the enemy&#8217;s camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been making plans for you.&#8221; Those strange
eyes measured hers. &#8220;Let me tell you what they are.&#8221;
The husky whisper was now a caress. &#8220;Stay with us
here and you shall have something big&mdash;a plum worth
having. As you know, we are planning a new paper
for women that we hope to make the finest property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
of its kind in existence. Now suppose you take control
at double your present salary and with a share in
the profits?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen was thrilled. Only a woman of ambition
could have gone so far already upon the road. This
was an opportunity she had foreseen and had been
steadily working for. To be in charge of such an
undertaking would not only gratify a keen desire; it
would be fulfillment almost beyond what she had dared
to hope.</p>

<p>She knew that the eyes of Saul Hartz were reading
her soul. As far as he was concerned there was hardly
such a thing as a secret. And with what uncanny skill
he could use his knowledge! The bribe was great.
For one of her mental outlook, the refusal of such a
bait would be a going-back upon her whole philosophy
of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t decide at once.&#8221; The whisper, faint though
it was, had a curious power. &#8220;But keep the door open
... keep the door open, that&#8217;s all we ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen remained silent. In the presence of this man,
immediately under his gaze, within sound of his compelling
speech, she was always less than herself. Everybody
in the Office felt like that. The most potent members
of the staff, and they included heads as hard and
brains as &#8220;picked&#8221; as the world could produce, were
seldom able to put up a fight against him. The Colossus
dominated all alike.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Saul Hartz went on, &#8220;it was due to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
that you came over to us here. I&#8217;ve always felt a
personal responsibility in regard to you. From the
first I believed in you&mdash;we believed in each other. You
have not disappointed me; I hope I have not disappointed
you. But it will hurt me more than I can say,
if for a whim, a mere whim, a day-dream, you throw
away a really fine career.&#8221;</p>

<p>To doubt his sincerity was impossible. Every word
rang true. And Helen Sholto with his spell upon her
was bound to react to the emotion this man had the
power to excite. At once her mind went back to the
many benefits at his hands, the many delicate kindnesses.
She could not forget his faith in her; she could
not forget how much she owed him.</p>

<p>While he looked at her all that was clear. He wove
a very close web. But he was too adroit to draw the
mesh too tight. He was careful not to embarrass her
by an appeal to her sense of gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, this is just a business proposition&mdash;a
business arrangement.&#8221; The sudden release of tension
was most welcome to Helen. &#8220;A quid pro quo,
one might even say. We have been mutually useful
to each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been very good to me.&#8221; A sense of justice
forced her to that simple admission.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you really think so,&#8221;&mdash;he had a wonderful gift
for taking instant advantage of every opportunity&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;ll
be in no hurry to turn us down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her distrust of this man had now grown profound,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
but with that implacable will enfolding her she began
to seem a helpless fly in the toils of an enormous spider.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take time for thought.&#8221; He recurred yet again
to his theme with the zest of one who knows his own
skill and loves its exercise. &#8220;The strongest and the
wisest of us are liable to moments of weakness in which
we may easily come to grief. I&#8217;m twice your age and
that&#8217;s my excuse for prosing. But don&#8217;t throw away
the substance for the shadow; don&#8217;t go back on your
whole life for the sake of a heroic gesture. The control
of the <i>Woman&#8217;s News</i>, with a combined minimum
sale here and in the United States of five million copies
a week, is going to be the prize of your profession.
Try to realize what such a chance means before you
sacrifice it to a chimera.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John Endor is no chimera,&#8221; Helen mustered the
wit to reply. &#8220;He is a great man. You know that as
well as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he looked at her in the way that had the
power of disconcerting everybody.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great man <i>ab ovo</i> shall we say? But I&#8217;m going
to be brutally frank.&#8221; A brief pause was well timed.
&#8220;He can&#8217;t stay the course; he&#8217;s geared too high.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it possible to know that?&#8221; said Helen valiantly.</p>

<p>The Colossus laughed. Slowly his eyes unhooded
themselves. She felt them strike like the fangs of a
cobra. &#8220;Dear fellow!&#8221; A curious lisp entered that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
remote voice. &#8220;Dear fellow, he&#8217;s down and out already.&#8221;</p>

<p>For one vital instant Helen&#8217;s heart seemed to miss
its beat. The will must not accept this ukase, but an
all-powerful instinct might dethrone it. Not for nothing
had this man earned his name. Caught and
pinned by his eyes she read what was behind them.
Even to the acute, balanced brain of Helen at this
moment he began to seem one with destiny itself.</p>

<p>Shivering with an emotion very close to terror she
was unable to move until his eyes let her go. Then
she got up from her chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a few days before you really decide.&#8221; Quite
suddenly his voice changed altogether. &#8220;If you are
writing, give my love to the old people in the old home.&#8221;</p>

<p>No other man would have dared that touch of audacity,
of jejune cynicism. Helen knew that well
enough, yet it didn&#8217;t make her fear of him less.</p>

<p>Returning no answer for there was none she could
give, she asked a question of routine and then, feeling
like one over whom a whirlwind had swept, she went
to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mind asking Mr. Gage to come?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chief&#8217;s reassumption of a formal tone helped
her to a becoming exit.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BENNET GAGE was a conspicuously able member
of his race. Every pore of his body, every cell
in his brain seemed to lust after &#8220;impressions.&#8221; He
lived with his ear to the ground, listening to the pulse
of the time. The price in the market of everything
was filed for reference in a prehensile mind; the rate
per ton for pig iron f. o. b. Sunderland, the exchange
on Christiania, or the value of an early Degas, Mr. Gage
could tell you offhand. And the information would
be the soundest obtainable. Moreover, a man of judgment,
Saul Hartz, who was almost incapable of a mistake
in such matters, had a great belief in him. From
the beginning he had been one of the directing minds
at the back of the portentous organization whose secret
aim was to dominate the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Gage,&#8221; was the cheerful greeting of the Colossus,
&#8220;all the morning journals have sung together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope, sir, you admired the <i>Planet</i> leader.&#8221; The
deference of Mr. Gage was touched ever so lightly
with humor.</p>

<p>With odd unexpectedness the Colossus loosed a sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
roar that almost shook Cosmos Alley to its foundations.
&#8220;My compliments to dear old Dalling. He&#8217;s
quite on his top notch this morning. A full four-ounce
packet of desiccated Pecksniff. Enough to turn
the stomach of a horse!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is to-day&#8217;s meeting at Hellington to be reported?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he is able to hold it, no,&#8221; was the prompt answer.
&#8220;If he is not able to hold it, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the book? Are we to review it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. By the way, who are the publishers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Burberry and Walker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Refuse all their advertisements until further notice.
Who is publishing it in New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ireson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The tenth of next month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They had better be stopped. I suppose they can
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; Mr. Gage&#8217;s nod was conclusive. &#8220;Ireson
is on the red list, fortunately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What an egotistical ass this fellow Endor must be.&#8221;
The voice of Saul Hartz had declined suddenly to a
whisper. &#8220;However, this young man is not the first
dweller in fairyland who has committed hari-kari.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a stealthy smile Mr. Gage agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much for that&mdash;for the moment,&#8221; said the Chief,
with a little purr of satisfaction. &#8220;Now, for more important
things. What are we featuring to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The attack on the British Consul at Peking.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>The Colossus pursed his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must we issue an ultimatum to the Chinese Government?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Give them forty-eight hours to apologize, or
take the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll apologize, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so, poor brutes! Still, as I told the
P. M. last night, it all helps to keep the pot simmering.
And sooner or later dear old man Chink will have to
be put to it. The trouble is, you see, that Brother Jap
will be at the poor old gentleman even if we consent
to keep our fingers off him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gage saw that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any particular news this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was lightly asked but before it was answered
the face of Bennet Gage became perceptibly
older. A look of strain came into a curiously somber
face, as he said, &#8220;Did you know that Garland is dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead! William Garland!&#8221; It was clear that, for
a moment, even the Colossus was taken aback. &#8220;Why,
I was in his company last evening at dinner at Rockingham
House. We had a most interesting, a most
informative chat about labor conditions all over the
world. He was leaving here on Friday for Australia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he may have arrived already,&#8221; said Mr. Gage
succinctly. &#8220;At all events, about half past eleven last
night, as he entered the Cosmopolitan vestibule, he fell
down dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saul Hartz was visibly startled. He pursed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
lips for a whistle that did not come. &#8220;About half past
eleven, you say, in the Cosmopolitan vestibule? Why,
an hour before I was talking with him in Park Lane,
when he was as hale and cheery as you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s all very mysterious,&#8221; said Mr. Gage,
solemnly.</p>

<p>It was clear that Saul Hartz was greatly impressed
by this piece of news. There was no longer a trace
of lightness in his manner when he said abruptly, after
a slight pause: &#8220;There&#8217;ll be an inquest, of course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. The police have already taken charge of
the body. But they are extraordinarily reticent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They suspect foul play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems absolutely nothing to be got out of
Scotland Yard. Verity&#8217;s with them now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colossus frowned. He produced from his
waistcoat pocket a toothpick and began to chew it
viciously. &#8220;We probably know quite as much as they
do, or very likely more. But Verity can be trusted, I
hope, not to give them cold feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From what he says&mdash;he went down to Whitehall
before breakfast&mdash;they&#8217;ve got cold feet already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they have!&#8221; Saul Hartz grew reflective.
&#8220;Then, in this case, they seem rather more up to time
than usual. The fact is, Gage, it&#8217;s no use disguising
that this affair wears a particularly ugly look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, undoubtedly, is Scotland Yard&#8217;s opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do they surmise to be the cause of death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Verity can&#8217;t get a word out of them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>Saul Hartz threw up his head sharply. &#8220;Very well,
see that they don&#8217;t get a word out of us. That&#8217;s a
game for two and we&#8217;re in a position to play it as well
as most people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Judging by the temperature in Whitehall at eight
o&#8217;clock this morning, Verity is inclined to think they
can tell us more than we can tell them. At any rate,
we are warned to go slow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Warned</i> to go slow! What do you mean, Gage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are to be specially careful how we treat the
news so that it may not conflict with the public interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, be damned to that!&#8221; The eyes of the Colossus
blazed arrogantly. &#8220;We shall treat the news as we
please. I wonder if they think we are going to take
dictation from a pack of old women.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gage looked rather dubious.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; said Saul Hartz, in the sharp crackling
tones that were used only on great occasions, &#8220;have
you spoken to New York? It&#8217;s possible they know
a little more than anybody at the moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Barrington rang them up as soon as the
news came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right. Bright fellow that. I hope he got
Manvile Lewis himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;Manvile Lewis. He didn&#8217;t think it wise to
discuss it with any one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so. Had their end anything to tell us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only that Garland had been warned before he left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
New York last Tuesday that he would not be allowed
to proceed to Australia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could have told them that. By the way, I wonder
if they know that in Whitehall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Verity suspects so, but he&#8217;s not sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right, no doubt.&#8221; Saul Hartz spoke keenly.
&#8220;And that&#8217;s their reason for making all this fuss. Do
you suppose they are up in those other two cases?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kornichef and Yamotoga?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Verity thinks they must be. He didn&#8217;t ask the
question but he gave Scotland Yard every opportunity
to bring them into the picture. But there was nothing
to be got out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I expect not,&#8221; said the Colossus, impatiently.
&#8220;However, this thing looks pretty ugly to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gage agreed.</p>

<p>The silence which followed was rather embarrassing
for the editor of the <i>Planet</i>. Instinctively, he knew
one, at least, of the thoughts that was already in possession
of the Chief&#8217;s mind. For one so expert in the
signs as Bennet Gage the face of the man before him
was easy to read. As the Colossus sat now at his
writing table with eyes shrouded, lips locked like a
trap and the tips of his fingers pressed together, he
seemed to exude a growing pugnacity. Scotland Yard
might be tempted to take this dark thing lying down,
but it was not in Saul Hartz&#8217;s nature to take anything
lying down.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;Gage!&#8221; The curious whisper broke the silence at
last. &#8220;We must go into this. We must go into this
fully.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cock of the editor&#8217;s head implied rather than
expressed a mild dissent. He did not venture upon
anything more explicit. It was no use opposing Saul
Hartz. One might as well oppose Niagara. Amenable
to argument he might be up to a point, but he
was a man of volcanic will who owed almost everything
to an unrivaled intuition. He had a first-rate
mind for affairs, but it was not by taking the advice
of others that he had won a unique place in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Big issues here!&#8221; The formidable jowl had unfurled
itself from a capacious collar, the brooding eyes
had disclosed their fires.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I grant that.&#8221; A slight tremor in Mr. Gage&#8217;s
voice told more than his words. &#8220;But it seems to
me, if I may be allowed to say so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; The words were impatient. &#8220;You know
that in this room you can say anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I would like to say this: It seems to me
that you of all men should keep off the grass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gage did not underrate his own prescience, and
he knew that Saul Hartz did not underrate it either.
But as the editor of the <i>Planet</i> uttered these significant
words, he had the look of a man who anticipates an
explosion. In this, he was not disappointed. But the
explosion, when it came, was less devastating than he
had feared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;Oh, be damned to that, Gage!&#8221; The Chief brought
his fist down solidly upon the table at which he sat.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t allow ourselves here to be intimidated by
anything or anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite!&#8221; The assent was a little uneasy. &#8220;But
knowing what we do, knowing what is behind all this,
is it altogether politic...?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Politic!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To take such risks&mdash;particularly when they are
unnecessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not agree that the risks are unnecessary.
It&#8217;s our clear duty to keep the police&mdash;or why not say
the Government?&mdash;up to the collar.&#8221;</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>Planet</i> cordially agreed, but in the
choice of the words which followed he showed great
care. &#8220;I do feel very strongly,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that faced as
we are with two evils, it is our duty to choose the less.
The police have asked us to walk delicately, and I
really think we ought to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the public interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The laugh of the Colossus was derisive. &#8220;In other
words, Bennet Gage finds life too agreeable to endanger
it lightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>That went to the root of the matter, no doubt. But
Mr. Hartz softened the thrust a little by offering his
cigar case with the air of a good fellow which he had
the valuable faculty of assuming on all occasions. As
he chose a cigar for himself, he became the soul of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
geniality, but Mr. Gage who knew him only too well
was not able to respond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you are worse than those duds at Scotland
Yard, my friend.&#8221; The gayety, if not exactly forced,
did not seem altogether spontaneous. &#8220;If you like,
I&#8217;ll make you a present of a pair of snowboots lined
with fur. They are the only things for your complaint.
And I hear you can get bedsocks at a reasonable price
at Selfridge&#8217;s white sale.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chief lit his cigar. Suddenly he began to smoke
furiously. Mr. Gage, who had declined a cigar, indulged
in odd, nervous little fumbles with his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Planet</i> must take a strong line to-morrow.&#8221;
Saul Hartz&#8217;s tone was plenary. &#8220;Report the inquest
fully. Have all the known facts in this case and the
other two cases got up carefully, and embody them in
a series of articles, to synchronize with the inquest.
<i>The Murder of William Garland</i> will make a good caption.
Norton or Lewis&mdash;I think perhaps Norton had
better write it. Let him come to me in half an hour and
I&#8217;ll give him my ideas on the subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dismissal was in the tone. Saul Hartz had no punctilio
with the men he employed, no matter how eminent
they might be in their own sphere. Even if he did not
parade the fact that he was the most important person
in the western hemisphere, he liked it clearly to be
understood in all matters of domestic administration
that his whim was law.</p>

<p>Bennet Gage was frankly distressed. His regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
for the Chief was akin to idolatry, but this was a
matter on which he felt bound to hold his ground. It
was due to them both that he should do so. But it
was far from the habit of the Colossus to take advice
and the knowledge of this fact often embarrassed those
who had to deal with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must we go into this matter at once?&#8221; The question
was more tentative than was warranted by Mr.
Gage&#8217;s state of mind, but to come out into the open
would be fatal.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sooner the better. Marshal all the facts. We
have to take a strong line here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the &#8216;murder&#8217; of William Garland.&#8221; Such a
nudity of phrase was altogether too much for Bennet
Gage. &#8220;Even if our information justifies that and
even if it is the finding of the Coroner&#8217;s jury&mdash;and
one can&#8217;t believe for a moment that it will be&mdash;is it
right?&mdash;is it in the public interest to run counter to
the police?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it in the public interest to cover up their incompetence?
that is the question we have to ask ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gage shook a deferential head. &#8220;Not so much
their incompetence, it seems to me, as their limitations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A distinction without a difference, my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all respect, I don&#8217;t agree. There is reason
to believe that they know more than we do. And
they have come to the conclusion that they are powerless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A conclusion wholly puerile and discreditable.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;Upon that I offer no opinion. But you remember
what Verity said on his return from Tokyo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and you remember what I said to Verity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. But if I may say so, in this business Verity
is the man on the spot. And he is most anxious that
we should accept guidance in the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saul Hartz laughed harshly. &#8220;The sooner daylight
is let into the whole thing, the better&mdash;that&#8217;s my view.&#8221;</p>

<p>The look of trouble deepened in the editor&#8217;s face.
&#8220;May I ask you not to forget that the police are up
against the stiffest proposition they have ever had to
tackle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have you turned devil&#8217;s advocate, Gage?&#8221;
Saul Hartz&#8217;s tone was sharply impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;On public grounds,&#8221; was the reluctant answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you are as bad as those old women in Whitehall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But look what has happened within a year. Three
clear cases. One in Tokyo, one in New York, and
now one in London. In each case a warning, a disregard
of the warning, followed in one instance by a
mysterious disappearance, and in the other two by an
even more mysterious death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no matter what Scotland Yard may say or
what it may do, we, at any rate, shall not allow ourselves
to be frightened by any kind of fee faw fum.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gage shook his head. &#8220;This terrible affair,&#8221;
he said weightily, &#8220;amply confirms the opinion I have
ventured already to express to you that the police are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
up against the most powerful and certainly the most
sinister force in the world to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chief was frankly annoyed. &#8220;Nonsense! I
refuse to believe anything of the kind. And in any
event, no matter what its power, we are going to fight
it. Tell Norton to come to me in half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>The keenly intelligent face of Bennet Gage clouded
heavily. With the look of a man who staggers under
a blow, he went to the door. But as he got there, he
changed his mind. Turning suddenly, he came back
several paces into the room. &#8220;It&#8217;s no use, sir.&#8221; The
voice was full of pain. &#8220;I know it&#8217;s a subject on which
you won&#8217;t listen to advice. But it&#8217;s one also in which
I feel I must obey my deepest instinct. Frankly, I
haven&#8217;t your courage. So that if you have fully made
up your mind to disregard these warnings, I must ask
you to announce in to-morrow&#8217;s <i>Planet</i> that I am no
longer its editor.&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">BENNET GAGE had delivered an ultimatum. The
Colossus was far from expecting it. He had
come to look upon the staunch, the tried, the absolutely
dependable Gage as a segment of his other self. Saul
Hartz would have been the first to own, for he was
fundamentally generous, that much of the <i>Planet&#8217;s</i> success
was due to the ability of its editor-in-chief; and
for himself there was no man on whose services he set
a higher value. At the same time he must follow his
star. No member of his staff was ever allowed to
oppose his will. Advice was sometimes sought, it was
sometimes taken, but even a man of Gage&#8217;s quality
could not be permitted to offer it, much less to insist
upon it, uninvited.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are talking like a fool, Gage, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; The
Colossus was too primitive to weigh his words overmuch
at any time; in a crisis his bluntness of phrase
seemed to add to his power. &#8220;Why go off at half
cock, my friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>Planet</i> folded his arms, a little
after the fashion of Napoleon, although he had too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
balanced a mind ever to feel in the least Napoleonic.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why,&#8221; he said after a moment&#8217;s pause.
&#8220;It may not be very logical and I daresay I shall live
to regret it, but there is something there that tells me&#8221;&mdash;he
pointed a finger ruefully whimsical at the pit
of his own stomach&mdash;&#8220;that at all hazards we have to
keep out of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not &#8216;we,&#8217; my friend.&#8221; The voice of Saul Hartz
took him up sharply. &#8220;Confine yourself to the first
person singular.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I say &#8216;we&#8217;, I mean the <i>Planet</i> newspaper, a
thing over and beyond myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be it so. And for that reason you must stand to
your guns. We can carry on, of course, without you.
No man is indispensable. But you are by far the
ablest person in this office with one exception ... put
that in your pipe and smoke it! ... and you mustn&#8217;t
think of leaving the ship at such a crisis.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the Colossus spoke he rose from his chair and
with the gesture of an elder brother laid a hand on
Gage&#8217;s shoulder. The elemental simplicity of the man
was hard to resist. Bennet Gage had always been
susceptible to it. Never had Saul Hartz been more
compelling than at this moment. But the issue at stake
transcended the personal equation.</p>

<p>A great effort was called for but Gage mustered the
tenacity to stand his ground. He idolized the <i>Planet</i>
and in spite of headstrong, domineering ways he idolized
its owner; but he was face to face now with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
very grave decision. &#8220;I beg you&mdash;I beg you&#8221;&mdash;his
voice shook&mdash;&#8220;to keep us out of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah&mdash;you old woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>Scarcely had the words been uttered, when Saul
Hartz was troubled to perceive the look of horror in
the eyes of his lieutenant. &#8220;Forgive me, Gage!&#8221; It
was almost the air of a schoolboy. &#8220;You&#8217;re not
thinking of yourself, I know that of course, but you
must, you simply must, trust the man at the wheel, as
you always have trusted him, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>For both, the silence that followed was full of pain.
And of a sudden it was ended by half audible words.
&#8220;I offer my resignation not because I want to, not because
I ought to, but because a power not myself....&#8221;
Unable to complete a sentence that grew more lame as
it went on, the editor of the <i>Planet</i> lurched awkwardly
out of the room.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">RUFFLED in temper, chafed in spirit, the Colossus
sought distraction in his morning&#8217;s mail. For the
most part his letters were not exciting. But the <i>bonne
bouche</i> was still held in reserve. The registered envelope
heavily sealed with black wax and ominously
edged with a mourning border, which had first caught
his attention, he was careful to keep back until all the
others had been opened. Finally, as its turn came, he
felt a queer little thrill of anticipation as he took it in
his fingers.</p>

<p>The emotion it aroused was not wholly agreeable.
Nay; it was so odd as to be a little unpleasant. What
could such a portentous thing contain? Before breaking
the seal he examined it closely. But externals told
nothing beyond what was to be deduced from the outside
of the envelope, which bore the postmark Charing
Cross.</p>

<p>From the inside he took a single sheet of plain note
paper. On it were typewritten the following words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">To the World&#8217;s Mischief Maker</span></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You are required to attend a special meeting
of the Council of Seven. Time and place
will be communicated to you in due course.
Meanwhile you are advised to put your affairs
in order.</i>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>There was no signature to this document. It revealed
nothing beyond these trite sentences, so cryptic
and so bald, which might mean so little or so much.</p>

<p>To Saul Hartz, however, this message implied a
great deal. It was his boast, and no idle one, that he
was the best informed man in Europe. The wonderful
organization of which he was the mainspring, the
controlling spirit, gave him facilities for knowing what
was taking place behind the scenes, not in England nor
in Europe only, but in every land of the habitable globe.
Many portentous and significant things, the aftermath
of the recent world upheaval, which were only hinted
at in senates and chancellories or vaguely guessed at
by private individuals and the public at large were
matters of common form to Saul Hartz. No man
alive had a deeper insight into hidden things. And
for that reason the shock he now received would hardly
have been felt by a person of average information or
experience.</p>

<p>This message, strange as it was, came as a blow he
had half foreseen. He was not unprepared, yet in
spite of himself he felt a little stunned by it. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
instinct of the dominant human male was to affect a
high contempt, but the instinct of a mind acquainted
with a thousand-and-one cross currents immediately
below the troubled surface of human society was very
different. As he stood at his writing table, holding
the letter in his hand, a chill seemed to strike at his
heart.</p>

<p>He was still in this attitude when Robert Norton,
one of the principal leader writers of the <i>Planet</i>, came
into the room. Norton, a brilliant Irishman of thirty,
was the master of a diabolically incisive but absolutely
unscrupulous pen. Without convictions of his own,
without faith, religion or a sense of justice, at every
fresh cast of the political horoscope he was ready at
a moment&#8217;s notice to make the worse appear the better
part in entire subordination to the abnormal mind by
whom he was rewarded with the salary of a prime
minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, Norton, good-morning!&#8221; It was a wrench for
the Colossus to break his reverie, but with an effort
he managed to do so.</p>

<p>Norton, typical product of the large public school
and the old university, bowed slightly. He was able
to hide the urbane irony of his race, and that was all.
With the air of a man at some pains to conceal the
fact that his tongue is in his cheek he waited for the
august Chief of the U. P. to speak again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you up in this Garland business?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was second nature with Saul Hartz to weigh his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
words. He took pains to adjust them to every fresh
mind with whom he was brought in contact. In his
daily intercourse with all sorts and conditions of people
he prided himself upon the faculty of saying neither
too little nor too much.</p>

<p>&#8220;One only knows,&#8221; Norton answered, &#8220;that about
twelve o&#8217;clock last night he fell down dead as he entered
the Cosmopolitan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more than that?&#8221; The careless tone, the veiled
eyes took all significance out of the question.</p>

<p>Such was the limit of Norton&#8217;s knowledge of the
matter, except that Mr. Gage had given him to understand
that he was required to write a leader on the
subject whose scope the Chief himself would indicate.</p>

<p>Saul Hartz made no immediate comment on this
rather dry answer. He seemed oddly silent and constrained.
For the first time in Norton&#8217;s knowledge of
him there was a look of indecision in his face. Suddenly
he said with a change of key so curious as to
be a little startling to one who knew him so well: &#8220;I&#8217;ve
changed my mind. We&#8217;ll postpone this Garland leader.&#8221;
He hesitated an instant, and then his voice changed
again. &#8220;Tell Mr. Gage I would like a further word
with him.&#8221; It was that tone of the high potentate
which was apt secretly to amuse men like Norton who
were constitutionally incapable of reverence.</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>Planet</i> obeyed the summons at
once. He seemed a bundle of nerves as he came into
the room. But his relief was keen when he was curtly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
informed that for the time being the Garland affair
was to stand in abeyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your resignation, I take it, will not appear to-morrow
in large pica on page eight,&#8221; said the Colossus
with a gleam of frost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not unless you hold me to it.&#8221; The look in the
large, dark, oriental eyes had an almost canine pathos.
Bennet Gage would not have been at all surprised had
the despot done so.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, carry on, my friend.&#8221; The words of the Colossus
were light, but a grim mouth belied them. &#8220;I
quite think we shall have to put all the cards on the
table, but this may not be the moment. Before taking
a definite line, it may be well to hear what the coroner&#8217;s
jury has to say on the subject. In the meantime, we
had better get to know whether Scotland Yard&#8217;s keeping
anything up its sleeve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Verity can be trusted there, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221; Saul Hartz, as he spoke, took the black-sealed
envelope from the table before him and slipped
it into his coat pocket. A weaker man would have
been impelled to take Gage into his confidence. But
the self-faith of the Colossus stood foursquare against
every shock. He was even ready to despise himself
for allowing such a piece of &#8220;mumbo jumbo&#8221; to upset
his plans. The fact remained that it had; but so far
as he could he was determined to minimize the effect
and to conceal the cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better make this to-morrow&#8217;s first article.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>As the Chief spoke, he opened a drawer in his writing
table and took out a printer&#8217;s galley proof, with a
number of corrections in his own forcible hand. &#8220;Instead
of &#8216;The Chinese Situation,&#8217; I&#8217;ve headed it &#8216;Plain
Words to the Celestial Empire,&#8217; and you&#8217;ll see I&#8217;ve gingered
it up generally. And Fuller might follow on in
the <i>Mercury</i> with &#8216;A Straight Tip to John Chinaman.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The editor cast an acute eye over the Chief&#8217;s flamboyance.
&#8220;A shade on the strong side, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;
But his tone had lightened considerably. To the mind
of Bennet Gage the mysterious death of an American
labor leader was a far more significant matter than a
calculated affront to several hundred million people.</p>

<p>&#8220;The stronger the better,&#8221; was the curt answer of the
Colossus. &#8220;I have very good reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gage did not question that.</p>

<p>&#8220;They can be bullied to any amount, dear souls!&#8221;
The Chief smiled sardonically. &#8220;And a little demonstration
of our power is called for just now. Every
newspaper&#8217;s first duty is to impress the groundlings.
But even that is not our real aim.&#8221; With an abrupt
laugh, which to Bennet Gage had a meaning far deeper
than mere irony, he suddenly dismissed the subject.</p>

<p>What an enigma the man was! That thought obsessed
the mind of the editor of the <i>Planet</i> as he went
out of the room.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER Mr. Gage had gone, Saul Hartz sat some
time at his table in deep thought. Then he began
to pace the room slowly and heavily, in a state of indecision
quite alien to his character. Finally, by pressing
the bell once, he summoned Helen Sholto from the
next room, issued a few brief but clear directions in
regard to the pile of letters on his table, taking care,
however, as he did so, to assure himself that the most
important one was in his coat pocket. And then putting
on overcoat and hat he affirmed his intention of
lunching at the Imperium Club and the probability of a
return to the Office about four o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartz&#8217;s slow walk from Fleet Street along the
Strand across Trafalgar Square was without real incident
until he reached Pall Mall. At various points
along the route it was illuminated by flaming news bills,
his own and his rivals&#8217;, proclaiming &#8220;Mysterious Death
of Famous Labor Leader.&#8221; At the very dangerous
corner, however, where the Carlton Hotel debauches
from the Haymarket, and where more than one recognized
ornament of human society has paid toll to
Moloch in his modern guise, the Colossus came within
an ace of being cut off.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>A mechanical contrivance propelled by a simian shape
in oilskins and a peaked cap, one of Plato&#8217;s two-legged
animals without feathers, crashed round the fatal corner
almost at the precise instant that Saul Hartz, fathoms
deep in thought, incautiously left the pavement.
How he managed to escape being run over was purely
a matter for the ironical deities who had his affairs in
hand. Escape he did, however. And so rudely had
his powerful mind been summoned to the needs of the
moment that he was able to observe that the engine
of destruction was armed fore and aft with placards,
bearing the single word</p>



<p class="center">GARLAND</p>

<p>The contraption itself was painted a flaming yellow,
the sign manual of the Universal Press, and surmounting
it like a halo was its world-famous motto:</p>



<p class="center">FIRST WITH THE NEWS AS USUAL</p>

<p>Perhaps the first emotion to arise in the outraged
being of the Colossus was regret that he had
not recovered quickly enough from his shock to take
the number of this friend of progress. It would have
been pleasant to deal with the creature in due season;
but if such a feeling was ever there, it was superseded
immediately by a sense of pride. As usual, the U. P.
was living up to itself. The efficiency of the grim
monster that had been created by his severely practical
genius was ruthless, astonishing, without a flaw. Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
a very little reflection was needed for the mind of
Saul Hartz to set the incident in true perspective. The
achievement of this obscure servant of the U. P. was
not a matter for censure. To dash round the Haymarket
corner at midday without warning, at the rate
of twenty miles an hour, was praiseworthy in the highest
degree. Feats such as that, on an ever-ascending
plane, without a thought for the rights of others, had
enabled the U. P. to declare, as usual, a dividend for
the last financial year of one hundred per cent, free
of tax.</p>

<p>Difficult as it was to know why at that moment the
mangled form of the Colossus was not on its way
in a wheeled ambulance to Charing Cross Hospital,
he was not a man to yield to an isolated fact of experience.
By the time he had passed through Jermyn
Street and had made the perilous crossing to Swan &amp;
Edgar&#8217;s corner, this minor incident was as if it had not
been. The mind of Saul Hartz was now engulfed in
a far more potent thing.</p>

<p>Near the entrance of the Piccadilly Hotel he stopped
and took from an inner pocket a small address book
bound in red leather. Memory reinforced, he went on
as far as the Albany and halted finally at a door towards
the Vigo Street end of that quaint caravansary.</p>

<p>The knock of the Colossus was answered at once by
a creature slightly more odd than his surroundings.
A pure bred Egyptian in a neat gray flannel suit, surmounted
by a taboosh, opened the door and greeted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
the visitor with a gravely impassive smile. The man,
slight of form, lustrous of feature, had an aloof dignity;
he had, moreover the noetic subtlety of a very
old civilization.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Wygram in? Give him my card, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>In the presence of such forceful, deliberate authority
the smile of the janitor became a bow. Mr. Hartz produced
a card. &#8220;Tell him, please, a very urgent matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man bowed again. Saul Hartz took this further
obeisance as an invitation to enter. With cat-footed
elegance the Egyptian silently bore the card
to his master.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SAUL HARTZ had not long to wait. Almost immediately
the Egyptian reappeared. Without
speaking a word he contrived to make clear that Mr.
Wygram would receive his visitor.</p>

<p>The Colossus was ushered at once into the presence
of a remarkable personage. A man about forty years
old was seated cross-legged on the ground, after the
fashion of the East, in a room hardly less exotic. Its
cushions, rugs and curtains evoked the Orient as surely
as the tchibouk its occupant was contemplatively sucking
and the fumes of the pungent-scented Arabian tobacco
which filled the whole place. The man who sat
on a cushion on the richly carpeted floor wore a burnoose,
slippers and a turban. In every detail of surroundings
and pose he recalled a very different scene,
but the dark-eyed, close-shaven face, in spite of a
withdrawn look which lent it a subtle asceticism, was
too fair of skin to suggest an exclusively eastern type.</p>

<p>The keenly penetrating Hartz who had never seen
this man before, was a little taken aback by the sight
he presented. Almost the first thought that entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
the visitor&#8217;s mind was that he had to do with an obvious
charlatan. The trappings of the East superimposed
upon the contours of the West did not inspire confidence.
Yet the reputation of this man Wygram was
such as to make it impossible to dismiss him lightly.
Humbug he might be, yet no one could have earned
such a name throughout the world, or rather the underworld
of high affairs, without being the possessor of
qualities which placed him entirely beyond the range
of ordinary people.</p>

<p>All the same a dyed-in-the-wool skeptic found it
hard to dissemble a secret pang which was more than
disappointment if less than disgust, as he confronted
this pseudo-oriental with a smile and a conventional
phrase.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is good of you, Mr. Wygram, to see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man on the floor removed the pipe from his lips
and bowed slightly. Between his slender fingers,
which were those of an &aelig;sthete and an artist, he held
the card of his august visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray, sit down,&#8221; he said, in a gentle voice of extraordinary
sweetness as the Egyptian closed the door
and left them together.</p>

<p>As Saul Hartz brought his solid bulk very slowly
and deliberately to anchor on the edge of a most seductive
divan, he felt pretty sure in his own mind that already
he had this merry-andrew sized up.</p>

<p>The man on the floor placidly resumed his tchibouk.
With a grave absorption, a more than oriental indifference,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
he continued to smoke. Evidently it was his way
of asking his visitor to explain himself. But the Colossus
could not help secretly resenting this detachment.
He was a very great man. It was idle to disguise that
fact. The world at large was even more keenly aware
of it than he was himself; therefore, the pose of this
creature Wygram was a little galling.</p>

<p>Saul Hartz was too much a man of the world to betray
his private feelings. But with an air more rapt
than that of any fakir, soothsayer or mystic, Wygram
calmly awaited the declaration of his errand. But why
declare it? A sudden doubt now stiffened the will of
the Colossus. Such a window-dressing fellow was a
European or most likely an American, the astutest
kind of westerner who knew how to wear his tongue
in his cheek. Why, therefore, disclose such an exceedingly
intimate matter to one whom instinctively he did
not trust; one who, moreover, might know how, should
occasion call, to turn such very perilous knowledge
against him.</p>

<p>It was not to be wondered at that the ensuing silence
was not immediately broken. To Saul Hartz it was
peculiarly trying. He was a man who had a right to
plume himself upon the faculty of knowing his own
mind. His fortunes had been built upon it. But now,
at this difficult moment, for almost the first time in
his life it deserted him. Should he confide in this charlatan
or should he not?</p>

<p>In the end it was the man on the ground who opened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
the ball. He removed the tube from his lips and said
with a curious absence of gesture, almost in the manner
of one who communes with the unseen, &#8220;I appreciate
your difficulty, Mr. Hartz. But in these little
matters, things are not always as they appear.&#8221;</p>

<p>This speech, delicately suave though it was, yet stung
the visitor to words of his own. &#8220;What little matters?&#8221;
he asked, with a sense of irritation that he knew to be
illogical.</p>

<p>&#8220;When busy men seek me out,&#8221; was the answer,
&#8220;they desire guidance, as a rule, in things beyond their
ken ... things which have suddenly, unexpectedly,
even terribly obtruded themselves upon their daily
lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curtly, Saul Hartz agreed. This cunning quack
was fishing for a clue to the business which had brought
him there.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are under no obligation to take me into your
confidence.&#8221; The voice was charming. &#8220;There was
no compulsion for you to come here at all. And now
you are here, you deplore your boldness. The dilemma
is quite intelligible. One even sympathizes with
it. But there is a short way out, if you will but consent
to take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very glad, if you&#8217;ll find one for me,&#8221; said Hartz,
in a voice that was half a growl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing simpler. Smoke one of my cigarettes and
I guarantee that your path shall grow magically
clearer.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>Saul Hartz scowled a little. Even when the man on
the floor made a long arm and took a box of wonderful
Indian inlay work from a tiny table near his elbow
and offered it with a smile of rare courtesy, the dubiousness
of the visitor was without disguise.</p>

<p>&#8220;No pressure,&#8221; Wygram held out the box with an
air of delicious irony. &#8220;Quite a free agent, my dear
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a swimmer taking a plunge into the Serpentine
on Christmas morning, Saul Hartz suddenly dipped
his fingers among the cigarettes. Moreover, with the
faint-smiling aid of his host he lit one defiantly, and
what was of even more consequence proceeded to
smoke it with an air of slight bravado.</p>

<p>It was a powerful, rare, full-flavored Arabian tobacco.
Mumbo jumbo, of course! However, he would
humor this trickster, who found it so easy to deceive
the world into believing that he was a wielder of
occult powers. Nevertheless, a dozen whiffs or so
cleared the brain wonderfully. Doubts melted. The
mind began to germinate. And the man on the ground
in spite of his queer trappings and his feline ways acquired
a power, an atmosphere, an authority that Saul
Hartz had never before conceded to any human being.</p>

<p>&#8220;You suffer from limitations, Mr. Hartz.&#8221; The
fall of the soft syllables had a music beyond anything
the Colossus had ever heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;We all do, don&#8217;t we?&#8221; he answered, with a first
gruff approach to geniality.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;Yes, but some in a greater, some in a less, degree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even to the verge of platitude! But the trouble
with you clean-run westerners, if you&#8217;ll excuse my
saying so, is that your minds can only react to one
small fragment of the Truth; and again, if you&#8217;ll excuse
my saying so, it is not the fragment that really
matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>At any other moment, the creator of the <i>Planet</i>
newspaper, whose circulation over five continents was
reckoned in millions of copies a day, would have challenged
this statement. A brain such as his susceptible
only to things that didn&#8217;t matter! Yes, the usual &#8220;gup&#8221;
of the inflated high-brow ass. But he was good to
listen to, this pseudo-oriental, for the simple reason
that he was clever enough to keep a special blend of
tobacco to soothe, tickle, stimulate the brains of his patrons.</p>

<p>&#8220;You &#8216;practical&#8217; men, who harness Niagara and
dream of making the material universe your servant,
who aspire to shoot yourselves out of a gun to the
planet Jupiter and back again, have got hold of the
wrong end of the stick, if you&#8217;ll excuse my saying so.
However, that&#8217;s neither here nor there. You are a
busy man with only a limited portion of what you are
pleased to call &#8216;time&#8217; at your disposal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True enough,&#8221; Mr. Hartz was now able to muster
his own private blend of raillery. &#8220;And you would
have one believe that what lesser mortals call time and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
space are completely transcended by such a mind as
your own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a manner of speaking, yes. If one is able to
glimpse the Whole its counterfeits don&#8217;t matter much.
But as I am sure you are not particularly concerned
with the Realities, perhaps you&#8217;ll tell me what I can
do for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hartz had now smoked the enchanted cigarette;
his ideas were clearer, his thoughts less turgid, but he
was not yet convinced that any good end would be
served by admitting the mysterious Wygram to his
confidence. Still, he hoped for enlightenment, perhaps
for a little advice. Many whom the world accounted
wise had bestowed upon this man undeniable credentials.</p>

<p>The visitor&#8217;s perplexity seemed rather to amuse Wygram.
&#8220;As a proof of my <i>bona fides</i>,&#8221; he said, after
a pause that held a threat of embarrassment, &#8220;allow
me to indicate your business. It has to do, unless I
am greatly mistaken, with the murder of Garland.&#8221;</p>

<p>Skeptical as he was, Hartz could not repress a start
of surprise. &#8220;How did you find out that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A simple matter. I claim no supranatural power:
at least as far as you are concerned, and as up till now
your affairs have been presented to me. But there is
a science of deduction, even if of late years it has
been sadly blown upon by writers of fiction. In other
words, two and two still make four&mdash;at all events in
a three-dimensional universe.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>Saul Hartz was a little impressed. &#8220;You claim access
to the fourth dimension?&#8221; he asked, rather na&iuml;vely.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be more immediately profitable, I think, if,
for the moment, we keep strictly within the scope of
this inquiry. You are troubled by the murder of Garland.
I use the word &#8216;murder&#8217; advisedly. You would
like to ask why? But let us pass on to its bearing
upon your own affairs. Why, Mr. Hartz, are you
troubled by this man Garland&#8217;s end? I hope you&#8217;ll
agree that it was richly deserved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An arch-blackguard, certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And therefore his fate was merited?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es. Perhaps. But I don&#8217;t hold with murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Saul Hartz spoke, a pair of vivid eyes completely
absorbed him. &#8220;<i>You</i> don&#8217;t hold with murder?&#8221; The
sensitive lips had a slight curl of scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, I do not.&#8221; The emphasis of the Colossus
amounted almost to indignation. &#8220;But why take it for
granted that Garland was murdered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beyond a doubt he was murdered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Proofs were asked for.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was warned by the Council of Seven,&#8221; said
Wygram.</p>

<p>Hartz gazed intently at the man on the ground.
&#8220;So you know about the Council of Seven?&#8221; In spite
of himself he could not keep an odd tremor out of his
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Wygram. &#8220;Perhaps I know as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
about the Society of the Friends of Peace as any man
alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>An imperious curiosity suddenly devoured Saul
Hartz. &#8220;A member of it, eh?&#8221; A feeling of intense
repugnance governed the framing of the question.</p>

<p>Wygram said calmly that he was not a member of
the Society.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you were&#8221;&mdash;Mr. Hartz disdained finesse
where his feelings were deeply engaged&mdash;&#8220;you would
have to deny it, I presume?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Expedient, no doubt,&#8221; said Wygram dryly. &#8220;But
I assure you the need doesn&#8217;t arise.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heavy face of the visitor lost a little of its gloom.
There was even a light of eagerness in the somber
eyes as he said: &#8220;May I ask one question? When
Garland arrived here from New York a week ago, did
he consult you professionally in the matter of his warning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did.&#8221; The answer seemed a little reluctant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sought your help and advice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sought the help you couldn&#8217;t give?&#8221; The words
were almost a sneer. &#8220;But no doubt you were able
to offer advice that he was not in a position to follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wygram laughed softly. &#8220;That is so, Mr. Hartz.
But if you hold these <i>a priori</i> ideas in regard to my
abilities why do you come to me yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t follow that I&#8217;ve come to consult you.
Howbeit, there is no harm in saying that I have. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
one hardly goes so far as to look for material assistance
from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In your dealings with the Society?&#8221;</p>

<p>The uncompromising question rather took Saul Hartz
aback. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t say so,&#8221; he fenced. &#8220;We were discussing
Garland. You say that Garland came to you
for advice. May I ask what advice you gave him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer did not come at once. Wygram drew
solemnly at his tchibouk. After a silence of several
moments he said with a cool picking of words, &#8220;Since
Garland didn&#8217;t choose to follow the advice I gave, it
may not be very profitable to disclose it&mdash;particularly
as I was out of sympathy with the man himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You offered advice all the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did. Out of no regard for Garland, with no desire
to save his life, but merely in the interests of the
community as a whole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Allow me to put this question.&#8221; Hartz&#8217;s senses
were now strung to the point of intensity. &#8220;Had Garland
followed the course you suggested to him, do you
suppose he would have been alive to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it highly probable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet in your view he was a bad man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had he taken the advice I gave him, he would have
been impotent to do further mischief. But who does
take advice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why give it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He came to me and sought it. I was enormously
interested in his case. He was one of the most remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
men I ever met. A creature of rare courage,
energy, force of will, he aspired to the kind of dictatorship
over his fellow men which seems to have such a
fascination for half educated minds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would rate such a man as Garland among the
half educated?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the rather less than half educated. At best
his power lay among the turbulent, seething proletariats
of the western world which enjoy political power without
having to pay for it, among the shiftless herds
which are out to grab the goods and chattels of their
more fortunate or more deserving neighbors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words, his aim was to set class against
class, so that he might ride to power on the storm he
had raised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Vide</i> the <i>Planet</i> newspaper.&#8221; A soft laugh floated
up from the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so!&#8221; The owner of the <i>Planet</i> newspaper
folded his arms with a fine gesture. &#8220;We take credit
to ourselves for revealing Garlandism in its true colors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And for drawing a dividend from your soap-and-water-using
public, while your string of tag, rag and
bobtail prints coax dividends from the millions who
have no use for soap and water but can always afford
a penny, a couple of cents, a few lira or half a mark
as the case may be to have their cupidity pleasantly
tickled.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colossus had heard the taunt so often that he
had learned to smile at it. &#8220;You do the Universal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
Press less than justice,&#8221; he said, with a touch of proprietorial
complacency.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt!&#8221; The answering smile was a little dour.
&#8220;But that is between you&mdash;and, shall we say?&mdash;the
Council of Seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of an iron will, Saul Hartz started at the
rather sinister deliberation of the words. &#8220;For the
present, if you don&#8217;t mind, let us keep to Garland.&#8221;
The attempt at rebuke was not altogether successful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wiser, no doubt.&#8221; Wygram, politely nonchalant,
pointed to the silver box. The visitor warily took a
second cigarette. &#8220;Garland was the only one of his
kind.&#8221; Wygram&#8217;s voice grew curiously soft. &#8220;And
his case, looking at it &#8216;in the round,&#8217; opened a door in
my experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I can readily believe.&#8221; Saul Hartz had no
afterthought. &#8220;From the details the Office has been
able to glean, the full story of Garland&#8217;s death might
be the biggest &#8216;scoop&#8217; of modern times.&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">FOR a little, while the two men smoked, there was
silence. They did not quite set each other&#8217;s genius,
it was clear. Between them was a subtle antagonism,
which yet on both sides did not deny a claim to respect.
Saul Hartz, at any rate, had now modified considerably
his first estimate of &#8220;the pseudo-oriental.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a second question I hope you&#8217;ll not mind
my asking,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;Do you know exactly
what agent was used to compass Garland&#8217;s death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221; Wygram&#8217;s tone removed every shred of
doubt from the mind of his questioner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your information would be of considerable value
to&mdash;shall we say&mdash;the police?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The police are in possession of it,&#8221; said Wygram
unconcernedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask how you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been acting for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hartz was at once alive to the significance of the
statement. &#8220;Are you at liberty to disclose the full
extent of your knowledge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At liberty, yes,&#8221; was the cool reply. &#8220;I never, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
any circumstances, touch a case without retaining complete
liberty of action. But in this affair, I am not
inclined to communicate what I know to a private person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be against the public interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So say the police. By the way, when were you
called in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning&mdash;at two o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t taken long to get at the facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A mass of data was available from those other
cases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yamotoga and Kornichef?&#8221;</p>

<p>Wygram&#8217;s calm avowal of full knowledge of those
dark affairs which so deeply stirred a section of the
world had a palpable effect upon Hartz. But he went
on with his catechism.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you allowed to examine the body?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you able to tell the police the exact cause of
death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>It went against the grain for Saul Hartz to believe
that Wygram spoke the truth, but tone and manner
overrode all doubt. He was piqued by the discovery.
For once, that proud creation of his own, the U. P.
secret service, was at fault. It was far from pleasing
to the Colossus that persons there were in the realm
so much better informed than himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>One fact clearly emerged. Report, for once, had
not overpainted the attainments of this man Wygram.
How to make use of them was the problem for his
visitor. The man was determined to lock away his
knowledge. It was plain that he set more store by the
police than by the U. P. But the Colossus had made
up his mind already that so valuable an ally must be
lured on to his own side.</p>

<p>With that end in view, Mr. Hartz produced at this
point the Society&#8217;s letter with its sinister black seal
and mourning border.</p>

<p>He handed it to the man on the ground.</p>

<p>Wygram read the letter. Then he held it up to the
light, also its envelope. His next act was to pass his
fingers delicately over the surface of both.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I tear a little off?&#8221;</p>

<p>Permission was readily given for him to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chinese,&#8221; was Wygram&#8217;s comment as he rubbed
a small piece between his thumb and first finger. &#8220;It
doesn&#8217;t mean very much.&#8221; Wygram negligently tossed
two or three tiny fragments on to the carpet. &#8220;However,
it serves to confirm a theory which is not going
to mean very much either, but is certainly a sidelight
on a most unpleasant affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll be as explicit as you can.&#8221; Saul Hartz
was now betraying a little anxiety. &#8220;It may be that
I have something at stake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a good deal at stake.&#8221; Wygram was not
one to temper the wind to the shorn lamb.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>&#8220;Do you think you can help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Wygram shook his head. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This
is a matter in which one person only can help you.
That person is yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such an answer was eminently unpleasant to Saul
Hartz. His voice grew harsh and domineering. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t intend to let myself be intimidated by any sort
of mumbo jumbo&mdash;if that is what you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;William Garland used almost those identical words
in this room less than a week ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colossus, in spite of the fact that Wygram&#8217;s
piercing black eyes were fixed upon his face, could not
repress a shiver. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me,&#8221; he said in a
lower tone, &#8220;exactly what you are able to deduce from
this letter and this envelope?&#8221;</p>

<p>Wygram pondered. &#8220;At this stage,&#8221; he said slowly,
&#8220;it would be premature, it would serve no purpose,
and perhaps it might be unkind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trying to give me cold feet, eh?&#8221; The voice of
the Colossus again grew harsh.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I want to avoid. At the same time,
if you value your life, don&#8217;t make Garland&#8217;s mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was Garland&#8217;s mistake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He defied the Council of Seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saul Hartz lifted an imperious chin. &#8220;What exactly
do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Society prescribed for Garland a certain course
within a certain time. His only chance of life was
to follow it, but that was a fact he chose to ignore.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>&#8220;No course has yet been prescribed for me, at any
rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colossus folded his arms with a gesture of defiance.
&#8220;That remains to be seen,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are bound to hear more of this matter.&#8221; Wygram
toyed with the paper that was still in his hand.
&#8220;The Society of the Friends of Peace has made up
its mind to break you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wygram&#8217;s eyes were fixed once again upon a face
which was betraying signs of an ever-deepening conflict.
&#8220;That hardly admits of doubt,&#8221; he said in a low,
solemn voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense ... nonsense!&#8221; The manner of the
Colossus was that of one struggling to throw off an
evil dream. &#8220;I refuse to be intimidated by this sort
of deviltry. I and my papers, I and my world-wide
organization, will fight this <i>Vehmgericht</i>. We will
scotch and kill it with the resources we command.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you may.&#8221; Wygram weighed his words
coolly. &#8220;Of two evils it is well to choose the less.
And that is saying much. For the U. P. is a foul
blot enough on our civilization, heaven knows. And
you yourself, sir, as I see you, are a sort of third-rate
antichrist....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Napoleon <i>in p&eacute;tto</i>, but a dire menace, all the
same, to the peace of the world. Still, your wings are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
about to be clipped and that is reason enough for honest
men to rejoice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saul Hartz resented these words deeply, but his arrogance
was too great to allow the fact to appear in
his manner. His laugh had even a ring of good humor.
Wygram, fully bent on taking the measure of
the man, did not let that laugh escape him. He rather
liked the fellow for being able to indulge it at such a
moment. After all, this brummagem Colossus might
be of larger mold than on the surface he seemed.</p>

<p>One thing was clear. They were well met, these
two. Each sought to assay the other, and if possible,
transmute any residuum of exact knowledge into
power.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are out of sympathy with my aims and ambitions.&#8221;
The mildness of Saul Hartz had quite an
apologetic sound. &#8220;But don&#8217;t for that reason blind
yourself willfully to the fact that the remedy we are
up against is far worse than the disease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t!&#8221; said the Colossus, sternly. &#8220;This
<i>Vehmgericht</i> is trying to put back the clock five hundred
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The U. P.,&#8221; said Wygram, &#8220;aims at even more than
that. It would reduce the whole world to slavery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A mere figure of speech, my friend!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not agree. The U. P. is now an international
ring of newspaper bosses which has corralled
everything that relates to the printed word. Cables,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
labor, paper, ink, power of distribution&mdash;it has cornered
them all. The time is at hand when the humblest sheet
of provincial gossip will be subject to your veto here,
and the veto of Breit in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing is impossible to the big serpent who swallows
all the little serpents. His capacity grows and
grows. The late war has definitely put back the clock
of mankind. Such phenomena as yourself, say the
wise, are proof enough that the human race is now
past its zenith.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colossus smiled. He was careful, all the same,
to veil any contempt he might feel for such reasoning.
It was his intention to use this man Wygram, inimical
as he was, so far as lay in his power.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just now,&#8221; said Saul Hartz, &#8220;in examining that
absurd letter in your hand, you let fall the word &#8216;Chinese.&#8217;
May I ask if you attach any particular significance
to the presence in London of Lien Weng, the
philosopher and mystic?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Wygram considered the question.
Moreover, he weighed carefully the range of information
of the man who asked it. Finally he decided to
answer. &#8220;Yes, quite a good deal,&#8221; he said frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do the police share that view?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t they move in the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For one of two reasons,&#8221; said the candid Wygram.
&#8220;Either they can&#8217;t, or they daren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>&#8220;Daren&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very deep minds are in this affair. The human
race, as you probably know, is faced with some ugly
developments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of which I am said to be the only true begetter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are others, less commonplace, in the higher
regions of thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not at liberty to disclose them. But I may
say this: your case, Mr. Hartz, has interested me
much, and its inevitable developments are going to
interest me even more. Therefore, at a later stage,
if you care to come and see me again, pray do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colossus rose from his cushioned divan with
rather a disgruntled look.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve not been particularly illuminating,&#8221;
said Wygram with a faint smile. &#8220;But I may be able
to reconcile it with a sense of duty to shed a little
light on your darkness presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has a sense of duty to do with the matter?&#8221;
The Colossus was hardly able to repress a snarl of impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of two evils I choose the less. Still, as I say, it
may be possible later to modify my views a little. I
hope you&#8217;ll come and see me again.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a courtesy more than oriental yet not wholly
free of a natural irony due to the circumstances, Wygram
rose slowly from the ground and took leave of
his perplexed visitor.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">JOHN ENDOR had arranged that after his meeting
at Hellington he should go on to Wyndham,
his mother&#8217;s house, some twenty miles away in the
neighboring county of Middleshire, and there spend
the week-end. Helen had promised to join him on the
Saturday. She had yet to make the acquaintance of
Lady Elizabeth, but now that the Rubicon was as good
as crossed, she was called upon to face the rather
dreaded music of the maternal criticism.</p>

<p>As things turned out, this week-end plan chimed
very well with the course of events. Thursday was
the day of the Hellington meeting; it was also the day
of Helen&#8217;s powerfully disturbing talk with Saul Hartz.
And at the breakfast table on Friday morning, when
she opened her <i>Planet</i> prior to setting out for the
Office, she received a further shock. Two heavy captions
on the paper&#8217;s front page at once caught her eye:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="large">RIOT AT HELLINGTON</span><br />
M. P.&#8217;S MEETING BROKEN UP</p>

<p>It was no more than she expected. John had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
refused a hearing. Missiles had been thrown, and,
finally, a hostile mob had stormed the platform. Moreover,
in the course of the fierce <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> which had followed,
the would-be speaker had sustained an injury
to his head.</p>

<p>On the way to the Office, Helen&#8217;s first act was to
telegraph to Wyndham for fuller particulars. The
three hours which had to elapse before a reply came
were spent in great bitterness of spirit. John might
or might not be sorely hurt, but this harsh sequel to the
wrong he had already suffered was going to make it
very difficult to forgive the authors of the mischief.</p>

<p>Precisely who those authors were, Helen, as yet,
was in a position only to surmise. The whole thing
was a cruel blunder on the part of the U. P. And yet,
as far as Helen was concerned, the real tragedy lay
in Saul Hartz&#8217;s defense of it.</p>

<p>As soon as she reached the Office, she at once pointed
out to the Chief what had happened. He professed a
sincere regret and promised that Mr. Endor&#8217;s denial
of his misreported Blackhampton speech, which had
provoked the trouble, should be immediately circulated.</p>

<p>&#8220;But one understood,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;that the contradiction
was to appear this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right,&#8221; said the Chief, with a fine
appearance of candor. &#8220;Presently I will go into the
whole matter with Mr. Gage and Mr. Fuller and Mr.
Bryant. They are entitled to stand their ground. One
feels for them&mdash;in fact, one quite sympathizes with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
their attitude&mdash;but they must not ignore instructions.
Mr. Endor&#8217;s contradiction, as I have already promised
you, shall be given full publicity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late, I&#8217;m afraid, to be of the slightest use now,&#8221;
said Helen, bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hope not,&#8221; said the Chief, with an oleaginous
purr. &#8220;It&#8217;s never too late to repair an indiscretion.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Helen&#8217;s temper showed a rising insurgency.
&#8220;To my mind,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the whole thing is indefensible.
It&#8217;s a blunder or worse, on the part of somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hartz did his best with soft words, but Helen
was deeply angry. Clearly he was afraid of losing
her and, rather than do so, he was ready to grovel.
Several times, indeed, in the course of this painful interview,
she was on the point of taking a definite, irrevocable
step, but the consummate tact of the man with
whom she was dealing was just able to stave off a final
decision. And yet, in Helen&#8217;s own mind, it was not
this diplomacy which really turned the scale; it was,
when all was said, a sense of deep loyalty to one from
whom she had received much kindness that became the
determining factor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand you&#8217;ve telegraphed for further news.
As soon as you hear, please let me know how he is,
unfortunate fellow!&#8221;</p>

<p>With that almost angelic valediction in her ears,
Helen retired. But anger, impatience, bitterness were
running riot. Her spirit was more than ever at war.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
Why had she not the resolution to break with this man?
As soon as she had forsaken the presence of this spell-binder
for the privacy of her own room, the stern question
had to be met. A breach was almost inevitable
now.</p>

<p>In a state of miserable indecision she returned to
her work. But all the morning her thoughts were elsewhere.
She could think of little save the answer to
her telegram. Just before one o&#8217;clock, however, came
the welcome news that John&#8217;s injury was not serious
and that he was looking forward to seeing her on the
morrow at Wyndham.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HELEN&#8217;S brief visit to the country proved to be
a rather severe ordeal. It began with a lonely
five-mile drive from the station in an antiquated
brougham. And, on arrival at Wyndham about six
o&#8217;clock on Saturday evening, a general state of tension
was not made less when she found that John in obedience
to doctor&#8217;s orders was keeping his bed, and that
his mother had mounted guard over him.</p>

<p>Lady Elizabeth was a dragon &#8220;of the old school&#8221;;
at least, that was the effect she contrived to make upon
Helen in the course of their first evening together.
A masterful dame of seventy, wonderfully active in
spite of growing infirmity, it was clear to the guest,
by the time she had spent ten minutes with her fianc&eacute;&#8217;s
mother, that she would have a head full of feudal ideas
to contend with. For the mistress of Wyndham, beyond
a doubt, was a survival of another age. And to
the modern mind of an American it was an age of considerably
less enlightenment.</p>

<p>John, for one thing, was her ewe lamb. And she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
had no thought of surrendering him lightly. Far from
approving his politics or his revolutionary coquettings
with &#8220;new ideas,&#8221; of all things the most deadly in his
mother&#8217;s opinion, she seemed to regard him still as only
fit for the nursery. He knew little about life, he knew
even less about women.</p>

<p>In their first quarter of an hour together over the
drawing-room teacups Helen was amused, irritated,
surprised, confounded by the calm assumptions of
Lady Elizabeth Endor. All her standards of life and
conduct were based on a rather remote past. John,
who had humor enough to make due allowance for the
old lady&#8217;s antique flavor, had done his best to prepare
Helen for a shock; all the same, a lively sense of the
comic was needed in Helen herself to make tolerable
that first evening at Wyndham.</p>

<p>Not the least trying circumstance was Lady Elizabeth&#8217;s
complete and resolute charge of the patient. If
he were able to get a good night&#8217;s rest and his cut and
bruised head became no worse, he might be allowed
&#8220;up&#8221; for a short time on the morrow. Meanwhile,
no one, not even his affianced, must venture to disturb
the peace of his chamber.</p>

<p>Helen liked not the ukase but she had to submit.
She had also to submit to dressing for dinner in a fireless
but moldily magnificent bedroom. Moldy magnificence
seemed, in fact, to be the note of that cheerless
house. It even extended to the dinner itself. Long
before that function was through, Helen felt that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
the most depressing and unsatisfying meal she had
ever eaten.</p>

<p>Behind the old lady&#8217;s chair was a solemn pontiff in
the form of a butler: a lord in waiting to a lady in
waiting to Good Queen Victoria. A lovely bit of mahogany
was before them; wonderful old silver, fine
napery and divers articles of &#8220;bigotry and virtue&#8221; that
excited Helen&#8217;s cupidity, lay all around; and yet the
whole scheme had such an air of historical solidity that
it might have come from Madame Tussaud&#8217;s, the Wallace
Collection, or the Ark.</p>

<p>The fare was so scant that Helen would have had
qualms about taking a full share had not her hostess
appeared to subsist on hot water and dry toast. Moreover,
it was ill cooked, sauceless, uninspired; and although
claret was offered with an air that conferred
the monarchy of all vintages upon it, the guest regretted
that she had not been content with a humble but
safe alternative in the form of barley water.</p>

<p>So much for the meal. As for the spirit which informed
it, Helen soon found that it was hopeless for
a mere &#8220;American newspaper person&#8221; of no particular
social credentials, to penetrate the <i>chevaux de frise</i> of
Lady Elizabeth&#8217;s class consciousness. To begin with,
judging by a stray remark the old woman let fall, it
seemed a source of mild surprise to find that &#8220;an
American&#8221; was not necessarily &#8220;a nigger&#8221; and that
&#8220;a newspaper person&#8221; was not necessarily &#8220;a printer.&#8221;
All the same, when the best had been said and every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
allowance made for the march of progress for any
woman to be actively engaged in earning her own living
was to place her in the governess category if not
actually to consign her to the lower depths with Mossop
the butler, and his highly trained subordinates, Charles
and John.</p>

<p>Had Helen been less troubled in spirit, a keen sense
of humor would have been frankly charmed by this
almost perfect specimen from the backwoods. John
himself always alluded to his mother as &#8220;a genuine
Die-hard.&#8221; It was her austere, yet not altogether unenlightened
feudalism, he declared, that had made England
the country it was. Cherishing her as he did, and
the wonderful old island of which she was the flesh and
the bone, he certainly claimed for her many fine qualities.
She was honest, she was wise in her own generation,
she was fearless, she had a downright way of
expressing herself, and according to her lights, she
was just. All the same, her limitations were many
and they were abrupt.</p>

<p>Charm, beauty, information, wit, Helen had her
share of these and she used them modestly, but so far
as John&#8217;s mother was concerned, they made no impact.
From his early days at Eton she had mapped out a
matrimonial career for her only surviving son. Money
he would need and money he should have, even if he
must go outside his own class to look for it. No doubt
some well-born heiress would come along&mdash;Lady Elizabeth
might despair of the country but she was an invincible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
optimist in all matters relating to herself and
family&mdash;she had heard, in fact, of a nice young heiress
in the next county, and John, although his &#8220;radicalism&#8221;
annoyed her deeply, being his mother&#8217;s son had merely
to cast the handkerchief.</p>

<p>Poor Helen was to learn in the course of the evening
that it would not be with the consent of her hostess if
she ever became Mrs. John Endor. The wind was not
tempered to the shorn lamb. John simply couldn&#8217;t afford
to marry under ten thousand a year; he had a
little, only a very little, of his own, and Wyndham was
one of those ramshackle old places, although good of
its kind, that was really so expensive to keep up.</p>

<p>John&#8217;s destiny, so to speak, was cut and dried&mdash;let
there be no doubt on that score&mdash;although his politics,
his general outlook, his &#8220;isms&#8221; were crosses for his
mother&#8217;s old age. Indeed, the attitude of Lady Elizabeth
to her distinguished son was that of an entirely
responsible barndoor hen who, by a whim of the gods,
has hatched a peacock. The ideas in which he trafficked
were so much colored moonshine, for which she
had simply no use at all. She was greatly surprised
that Eton and Oxford had failed to knock such pernicious
nonsense out of him. <i>Ne sutor ultra crepidam</i>
was the motto she believed in. Old as she was,
and rather too infirm to wield a stick with the vigor of
her prime&mdash;the irony of the matter was, that a Spartan
parent had always bestowed great pains upon his youth!&mdash;she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
did not despair, even now, of seeing this renegade
back in the fold.</p>

<p>At any rate, the renegade&#8217;s mother was fain to inform
the edified Helen that the knock on the head he
had received the previous day from the Hellington
miners would do him all the good in the world. &#8220;A
gentleman has no right to go among the rabble. They
have no more use for him, than he should have for
them. I hope they&#8217;ve hit him hard enough, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even Helen, a woman of the world, hardly knew
whether to be shocked or amused by this downrightness.
She compromised by being both. And greatly
daring, she ventured presently to take up cudgels for
her stricken hero.</p>

<p>Was it possible Lady Elizabeth didn&#8217;t realize that
one day John might become Prime Minister?</p>

<p>The Die-hard would be surprised at nothing, but
in times like these it was little enough to any one&#8217;s
credit to become Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Helen, a little staggered, yet secretly charmed, did
her best to develop the subject, but the old lady would
have none of it. Abhorring John&#8217;s ideas, she refused
to take their owner seriously. The truth was she had
never quite got over the shock of his flaunting a red
necktie at Christ Church and being called in consequence
&#8220;Comrade&#8221; Endor.</p>

<p>At the back of Lady Elizabeth&#8217;s mind, no doubt, lay
the hard fact that this Miss Sholto was not the least
fantastic of &#8220;Comrade&#8221; Endor&#8217;s &#8220;isms.&#8221; She had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
right to be there, and Helen was quick to penetrate to
that cold truth. On occasion, however, she could be
mischievous, and by the end of a trying meal she had
decided that the only fun that evening was likely to
provide would consist in drawing the old lady out.</p>

<p>She fell back, therefore, on tracing relationships.
In Helen&#8217;s opinion, it was a poor game at best, but
it served at least to keep the ball of conversation rolling
in the drawing room. Lady Elizabeth&#8217;s tree was
immensely distinguished; she was the second daughter
of no less a personage than the fourth Duke of Bridport.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; said Lady Elizabeth, &#8220;had the name of
a very clever man. But his own class never forgave
him for introducing what was called The People&#8217;s Charter
in the House of Lords. He certainly thought too
much of the workingman, gave him free education,
cheap beer, and so on. My father&#8217;s weakness for the
masses made him innumerable enemies. People called
him Brother Bridport or the Mad Duke. When he
left the Tories and went over to Gladstone, even his
lifelong friends turned against him, the dear Queen
among them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that was why he was called the Mad Duke!&#8221;
said Helen. The deadly phrase used by Saul Hartz recurred
to her vividly: <i>madness in the mother&#8217;s family</i>.
Was it possible that the charge was based merely on
the reputation of the fourth duke of Bridport? Helen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
felt a weight lifted suddenly from her mind. And
yet, if this theory was sound, it was one rag the more
torn from the reputation of a man whom she had implicitly
trusted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sometimes think,&#8221; Lady Elizabeth went on, &#8220;that
my unfortunate boy gets his eccentricity from his
grandfather. All the rest of the family were so sensible.
I can hear my Uncle Edmund saying to my
father, &#8216;Robert, the world is a good enough place as
it is, if only fools like you will let it be.&#8217; A shrewd
man Uncle Edmund. &#8216;You&#8217;ll put the workingman on
top, and then you&#8217;ll be happy,&#8217; he used to say. If Uncle
Edmund could have had his way he would have hanged
poor papa at Hyde Park Corner. And that is how I
feel about that wretched boy upstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen was hard set to keep her gravity. But she
was just equal to the task. Moreover, with those sinister
words of Saul Hartz still in her ears, there was
yet a private end to gain. &#8220;Your mother&#8217;s people&#8221;&mdash;of
malice prepense she paused; it was so important to
frame an innocent-seeming question in just the right
way&mdash;&#8220;were much too wise, I suppose, to give away
their own?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, yes,&#8221; was the emphatic answer. &#8220;Canny
Scotch folk who knew better than to give away anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Due in part, no doubt,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;to living in a
poor country where there may not be much to give.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
But I am perhaps a bit sensitive on the subject, because
you see I happen to have Scotch blood myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trap was laid with skill and masked with cunning.
At any rate Lady Elizabeth walked right in. &#8220;My
mother&#8217;s mother was a Sholto of Bannocksyde.&#8221; The
proud old woman had an entirely misleading air of
stating a fact of really very little importance.</p>

<p>Helen, too, could be adept with the pride that knows
how to ape humility. She was content to offer a little
mild surprise, and that was all. Everything, so far,
was according to plan. She was quite aware that
John&#8217;s great grandmother was a Sholto of Bannocksyde,
but Lady Elizabeth was not aware that the
Sholtos of Virginia were a cadet branch of the same
ancient line. With becoming modesty, Helen now revealed
this interesting fact.</p>

<p>Lady Elizabeth proceeded at once to &#8220;sit up and
take notice.&#8221; It was as if her guest had suddenly
&#8220;come alive.&#8221; Helen could not resist a smile. A
strange land, this England! her impious thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, my dear,&#8221; A new note had entered the
raven voice of the old Die-hard. &#8220;Tell me, did your
people go over with Columbus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I forget the year Columbus sailed,&#8221; said Helen demurely.
&#8220;We went over, I believe, in 1680.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Burke will tell us,&#8221; said Lady Elizabeth with simple
faith.</p>

<p>On that point, Burke was hardly so clear as John&#8217;s
mother expected. Helen was able to convince her, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
the same, that in the year 1680 her fathers had settled
in Virginia, and that her own parents were still living
on the banks of Rose River in a house which had been
built by the original pioneer, Douglas Graeme Sholto.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE next day, which was Sunday, began with a
surprise for Helen. When she came downstairs,
exactly two minutes after the clock chimed half past
eight, she found the servants to the number of sixteen
kneeling in the hall and Lady Elizabeth reading prayers
in a rigid evangelical manner. Suddenly, the heart
of Helen took a leap across the Atlantic. The wanderer
was back in her own home; she saw and heard
her own mother, who alone of created beings she
suspected of practicing this ritual. The flat voice,
with its curious, low monotone, the stiffness of the
central figure and those around it, even the soft play
of light from the diamond panes upon the wonderful
Tudor paneling, brought back her childhood with a
rush. As Helen knelt in the midst of these people she
was once again among her own.</p>

<p>John had had a fairly good night. His temperature
was back to normal, and his Spartan parent had given
a tardy consent that, provided Dr. Evans, who was
expected in the course of the morning, confirmed it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the patient should come down to luncheon and eat roast
beef. &#8220;Of course, my dear, he ought to stay in bed
until to-morrow, but Dr. Evans is a weak man so he&#8217;s
sure to get round him. However, we mustn&#8217;t let that
keep us from church.&#8221;</p>

<p>For church they set out accordingly twenty minutes
before the doctor was due; and Lady Elizabeth, helped
by stout boots, a short skirt, and an ebony cane, walked
an honest three quarters of a mile across the beautiful
park with a practical strength of spirit that Helen could
but admire. Again it might have been her own mother
in her own home, except that Lady Elizabeth was older
than her mother by twenty years.</p>

<p>Sustained by the hope of John at luncheon, Helen
did not find the service, although in itself decidedly
uninspired, so hard to bear as otherwise it might have
been. She hoped she was not guilty of the sin known
to the Greeks as <i>hubris</i>, but she could not kill a feeling
that John and she lived in another time, another
mental atmosphere, another world. This handful of
bovine rustics, stiff and uncomfortable in their Sunday
clothes, listening vacantly to a string of <i>clich&eacute;s</i> which
they didn&#8217;t comprehend and for which they would
have been none the better had they been able to do
so, how pathetic they were! And the &#8220;pi-jaw&#8221; delivered
falsetto in the high voice known to Victorian
days as an appanage of &#8220;the Oxford manner,&#8221; how
incongruous, how outworn it was!</p>

<p>The church itself, however, was another affair. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
was an exquisite piece of early Gothic, nearly perfect
of its kind, an authentic bit of the Middle Ages.
While the old lady sat rigidly upright in her high-backed
pew facing the chancel, her eyes fixed upon the
clergyman, her ears struggling to catch and hold every
one of the rapid, slovenly, half meaningless words that
fell from his lips, the living alert mind by her side could
not help reflecting that human nature did not change
through the centuries. The Lady Elizabeth and her
feudal retainers of six hundred years ago must have
been like these! The same shibboleths, the same arcana,
the same crude paraphernalia to enable one to
make the best of this life and the next!</p>

<p>On Helen&#8217;s return to the house, full of a sense of
duty stoutly performed, she was rewarded by the sight
of John. He was sitting in the bow of the drawing-room
window to catch the fugitive warmth of an October
sun. A bandage was round his head and she
was a little shocked to see how pale, how shattered,
he looked. But as soon as he saw her he got up at
once and took a quick step towards her, both hands
held out like an eager, impulsive child.</p>

<p>If she had ever doubted her feeling for him, or had
not weighed it adequately, their coming together now,
in these tragic circumstances, seemed to define it anew.
He was looking weak and ill, but apart from that he
was much changed in three short days. Since the
evening of Thursday, just before he received the enemy&#8217;s
first blow, he looked older by twenty years. Something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
had passed out of his nature, something had
crept in.</p>

<p>He was possessed now by a sense of frustration, anger,
defeat. Fully, even whimsically, he was conscious
of the unhappy bedfellows who had entered his brain.
&#8220;It is wonderful,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how a knock on the head
may change a man. The short way to madness, I daresay.&#8221;
He spoke with a bitterness that did not belong
to his nature.</p>

<p>Such words did not soften Helen&#8217;s distress. They
did not arise from physical suffering; there was neither
fever nor pain; he was still a little weak, but otherwise
not ill. The cause was within, somewhere deep down,
at the root of being. Looking at his drawn face and
tragic eyes, listening to his slow, enfeebled voice, the
words of Saul Hartz came back to her. &#8220;He&#8217;s down
and out already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Could it be so? Had his will been broken by this
blow? Were those high, ennobling hopes which made
him the man he was now permanently destroyed? She
would not believe it. And yet, as she talked with him,
a haunting fear flooded her mind. He was like one
who bleeds internally. There was nothing that showed
and yet there was dire reason to suspect a lesion of
the soul.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, after a playful passage at arms
with his mother who was determined to exalt him into
&#8220;a case,&#8221; he took Helen as far as the gazebo at the end
of the terrace. Here for a full hour they sat with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
generous sun upon them. Spread before their eyes
was a lovely panoramic sweep of country. Out beyond
the distant ring of fir-clad hills were the immensities.</p>

<p>As they sat side by side looking in silence and awe
upon this wonder of wonders, a measure of healing
came to them. The tragedy of their own frail humanity
filled their hearts and drew them closer together.
They saw themselves and one another as they
were, two hapless specks of life. And yet with what
tenacity they clung to it. Poised crazily in the middle
of a narrow plank, rotten with age, over a bottomless
abyss, one false step, and they were as though they
had never been. That image of mortality filled their
minds. To both alike, in those unforgettable moments,
came knowledge of the stoicism that was needed in
men and women who sought to overcome destiny.</p>

<p>Neither John or Helen had the depth of mind of
the real thinker. In action lay their strength. To improve
one tiny niche of the world they knew but very
little was all they sought. But they were open to impressions,
intensely alive. And each had a secret ear
to catch, no matter how fitfully, how faintly, the pulse
of the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we humans,&#8221; said the sick man, &#8220;we hapless
two-legs sit in our gazebo trying to peer behind the
sunset, as you and I are doing now, we always seem
to be up against one question. Is there anything really
to be hoped from science? It is contriving all sorts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
of wonders, they say. The elixir of youth has been
found. There shall be length of days for those who
desire it. A remarkable vista is opened up by these
recent discoveries. Here is a most fascinating book,
a translation from the Chinese, which is causing a
great stir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen was shown the small volume in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lien Weng, I see,&#8221; was her comment. &#8220;They were
talking about him the other evening at the Bryants.
He has revolutionized psychology, they say, whatever
that may mean. One hasn&#8217;t the mental machinery
really to get at this sort of thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beyond me, too,&#8221; said John. &#8220;One can&#8217;t quite
reach to what he&#8217;s driving at, although the translation
seems pretty exact.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen read aloud the title of the book: <i>New Uses
for the Will</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or how to interpose your own upon the lives of
others&mdash;that&#8217;s what it seems to boil down to, as far
as one can make out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen could not withhold a slight shudder. &#8220;The
idea sounds distinctly unpleasant to me. Instinctively
one shuns it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may have its ugly side,&#8221; John agreed. &#8220;But it&#8217;s
reassuring to know that for the practice of this new
and ticklish science, certain conditions have to be present
in the mind of the subject to start with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like the old-fashioned hypnotism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lien Weng claims more for it than that, much more.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
One&#8217;s actions can be controlled from a distance, without
physical contact of any kind, simply by the massed
power of thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How horrid! And how uncomfortable!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, I grant you. But we live in an uncomfortable
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t the world largely what we make it?&#8221; said
Helen softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A week ago one would have said yes. But I&#8217;ve
had a knock on the head since then. Everything is
altered.&#8221; He forced a sudden laugh which jarred a
little on Helen&#8217;s nerves. &#8220;But, to return to this diabolically
clever old Chinaman. I&#8217;m swotting up his
book, because this day fortnight&mdash;touching wood!&mdash;I
shall be at Doe Hill at Rose Carburton&#8217;s, and the great
Lien Weng himself is expected to be there. So you
see one is likely to hear a great deal about his theory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather too much about it, perhaps,&#8221; said Helen
chaffingly. &#8220;He might consider you a fit subject for
one of his experiments.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearly she was not inclined to take Lien Weng too
seriously. John for his part, however, was impressed
by something he had read in a book which had caused
a flutter in the dovecotes of science; or it may have
been something he had heard as to the reputation of
its writer. &#8220;Great discoveries are in the air,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;At any rate, George
Hierons thinks so.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>&#8220;Hierons the inventor. You know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to know him at home. And I met him again,
the first time for some years, at dinner the other night.
He had just arrived from Ottawa, although like myself
I&#8217;m proud to say he&#8217;s an American citizen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a wonderful man. Another Edison, people
seem to think. I met him in New York last year.
He impressed me enormously. For a man still young
he&#8217;s gone a long way already on his own lines, and he&#8217;s
expected to go farther. His grasp of general world
conditions and their relation to modern thought in its
present state of continual flux was amazing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen agreed. She too, was quite fascinated by
him. Apart from his work, the importance of which
could hardly be exaggerated, George Hierons had the
mind of a seer.</p>

<p>There was a note, however, in this enthusiasm which
suddenly cast Endor into an odd change of mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us hope,&#8221; he said, with a melancholy so intense
that to Helen it was like a blow over the heart, &#8220;that
he won&#8217;t try too much. To me that seemed his danger.
Wasn&#8217;t it Goethe who said that man must learn
first to know where his problem begins? Minds of the
Hierons&#8217; type don&#8217;t always recognize how small are the
resources of humanity. The best, the wisest, the
strongest, all are in chains. Man is a slave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen was unready to accept so hard a saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;One can but read the riddle by the inner light,&#8221;
Endor went on. &#8220;Since this time last week I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
shed many illusions. Now am I fully awake, having
lived forty years, to the fact that man is chained in a
galley or, if you prefer the figure, harnessed to a
chariot with the Furies in charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen shivered at the strange light in his dark eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many ages, through what &aelig;ons of time this
has been his lot there is no God to tell him. What
mysteries he has profaned in the dim past, who shall
say? But wherever the primal urge may lead, man
has to follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She let her hand rest lightly in his. &#8220;How cold you
are!&#8221; she said. &#8220;We had better go back to the house.
I&#8217;m afraid you got up too soon on my account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest&mdash;no!&#8221; Like a lover he pressed his lips
upon her fingers. &#8220;I am quite well again in body. But
I am what you might call a little &#8216;thrawn&#8217; and it is
my duty to tell you. Now that I have had this knock
on the head, you&#8217;ll be taking a risk if you marry me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The simple words in their deliberation plucked at
Helen&#8217;s heart. &#8220;Don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t say that!&#8221; she gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you too well, my darling, to keep you in the
dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a will.&#8221; Her fingers tightened upon his.
&#8220;Use it, I beg you&mdash;use it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must. I do. But I am in the grip of forces
stronger than myself. I am called to battle with a
monster. He is in my stars. And he will kill me
... unless....&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>&#8220;Unless?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hung upon an answer which seemed an age in
coming&mdash;an answer which in reality she had to force
him to make.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kill him.&#8221; Involuntarily his hand strayed to the
bandage that had been fixed above his right eye. &#8220;It
is not revenge. It is far more than that ... the job
one was sent here to do ... to remove a deadly menace
from this unlucky world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen fixed her eyes on the drawn face of the man
she loved and believed in as she said slowly, &#8220;You&#8217;ll
surely do that if you don&#8217;t lose heart. One of your
powers can do anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Less than a week ago that was my own opinion.
Since then something terrible has happened.&#8221; He
forced a laugh which sounded harsh and unreal. &#8220;A
knock on the head has changed all that. One realizes
now what one is up against. What chance has a penny
trumpet? Can it persuade the walls of Jericho to fall
down? Can it drown the thunders of the U. P.?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely yes, if you have faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let us deceive ourselves. There are facts to
face. This monster has been well called the Colossus.
And his power is great. In this country, at least, he
is the absolute dictator of public opinion. Controlling
the wires in the way he does&mdash;nearly every newspaper
in the United Kingdom has now been forced by the
mere cost of its production to enter his Trust&mdash;he
sways these islands from end to end. At Hellington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
it was incredible what a plain, uncolored lie could do
in so short a time. They simply wouldn&#8217;t hear me.
All morning journals had sung together. And a Fleet
Street Lucifer, a twopence-daily antichrist, had composed
the tune.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grief, concern, pity were in the face of Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;One had always hoped and felt,&#8221; he went on with
anger stifling his voice, &#8220;that this noise and vanity,
this catchpenny patriotism, this lipservice to the majority,
this bag of cheap tricks, don&#8217;t really count&mdash;in
the sum of things. But they do. Hellington teaches
one that. The malign force that lured the Hun to his
doom is now about to deal with what remains of civilization.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why? ... but why? ... but why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The ambition of Saul Hartz is insensate. Like all
of his kind before him, he doesn&#8217;t know when to stop.
By that sin fell the angels. Cheap, debased, vulgarized
he may be, but he is still Lucifer, Son of the Morning,
in up-to-date clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen, while she listened, was torn with pain. She
loved this man. This creature of intuitions, now
broken and tormented, had grown more than ever dear
in the course of four terrible days. The desire to help
him had never been so strong. He could read that
in her compressed lips, her burning eyes. But very
gentleman as he was, now the case was altered, now he
could no longer count on the integrity of the central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
forces, he was ready, almost eager in his own despite
to release her.</p>

<p>One thing was now clear. They must come to a
decision. Again in the inward ear of Helen sounded
that voice grim with menace: Under which king,
Bezonian? To serve both was now impossible.</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t hesitate to tell this stricken, perhaps mortally
stricken, gladiator, that she was wholly his. Yet
no longer self-secure, a tide of doubt swept his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a little time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is your own
life to think of. It may be&mdash;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;that I
am no more than a half-crazy egoist; in any case, I
have no right to involve you in what may prove the
ruin of all our hopes. You have made a position for
yourself. Something is due to your career. I have
no right to drag you down, I have no right to sink your
fine abilities in a cause which in my heart I feel to be
already lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not only the simplicity of the man, but his honesty
in this hour of desolating weakness wrung her with
pain. &#8220;I ask no more than to serve you in any way
I can,&#8221; she said, her face raised to his.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot take pity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Even though it is a
gift which ennobles the giver. Too much is at stake
for us&mdash;and for the world in which we live.&#8221;</p>

<p>With more than a lover&#8217;s tenderness which made her
whole being quiver like the rays of light upon the path
before them, he took her in his arms and pressed kisses
upon her forehead and lips. In the next moment, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
as she gave herself up body and soul to his embrace, he
was able to fight his weakness again. With a shudder
he let her go. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let me drag you over the precipice,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Nothing now may be able to save me.
Therefore, if you still have the power, stand clear.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SAUL HARTZ, after a little weighing, that was
half contemptuous, of the pros and cons of the
matter, decided to accept Mrs. Carburton&#8217;s invitation
to Doe Hill. He did not know who was to be of the
party, nor did he much care. That there would be a
house full of entertaining people could be taken for
granted.</p>

<p>Rose Carburton was a power in the social world.
Her week-ends were famous. For a variety of reasons,
not easy to define, the Colossus was seldom
honored in this way. It was a little odd perhaps that
a man whose flair for &#8220;news&#8221; took him everywhere
on principle should not have found himself oftener in
a house where it was generally to be had in liberal
quantities. Doe Hill was by no means exclusive. Its
doors were open pretty wide to the talents. Saul Hartz
was just the kind of man the world would look to
find there. He knew Mrs. Carburton in the way he
knew so many people; at more than one dinner table
he had come under the spell of her attraction, but this
was the first time, in recent years at any rate, that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
had shown a desire to carry farther a casual acquaintance.</p>

<p>The truth was, no doubt, that they didn&#8217;t quite set
one another&#8217;s genius. Rose Carburton was something
of <i>une maitresse femme</i> and the dark shadow of the
Colossus had fallen not without menace, as was its
way, across her path. Over and beyond the fact that
she was one of the most accomplished stalkers of the
lion in Europe, she had her private ideas, her philosophy
of life, her point of view. She was far more
than a mere hunter of notoriety. Not only were her
political instincts highly developed, but she had a faculty
not always given to her sex, of seeing things &#8220;in
the round.&#8221; Mindful of the commonweal she had
learned to look ahead. It may have been that, to a
gaze so far-seeing, Saul Hartz was the writing on the
wall.</p>

<p>The Colossus had much to occupy his thoughts in the
ten days that lay between the arrival of the Society&#8217;s
ukase and the visit to Doe Hill. When, how or by
what means he would be called to its presence, no
word was given him. This thing had come as a sharp
and distinctly unpleasant shock, yet considering the
matter with the poise of mind on which he prided himself,
he did not pretend for a moment that it was in
any sense a surprise. At the core of being was a nest
of dark designs. Their nature had only to be suspected
for powerful and implacable foes to take the
field against him who dared to harbor them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>He was most careful to keep his own counsel in
the Office. No member of the staff, not even the
<i>Planet&#8217;s</i> editor, was given an inkling of the grisly secret
he had locked away. All the same, his interview with
Wygram, when at leisure he came to think it over, had
a sobering effect. Wygram had brought home to him
that his life was in grave danger.</p>

<p>For the time being, therefore, Saul Hartz gave up
the project of issuing a challenge to Garland&#8217;s murderers.
It went against the grain, for the worst enemies
of the Colossus allowed him to be no coward.
He had a burning desire to divulge all that he knew,
but apart from motives of prudence one consideration
held him back.</p>

<p>The cat could only have been let out of the bag at
a price. That price was the loss of his right-hand man,
Bennet Gage. And this, at such a moment, was not
to be thought of. Already he was deeply involved in
a fight with the odds heavily against him. Life itself
for Saul Hartz, was one interminable strife. And now
at this supreme crisis, with his back to the wall, he
must have all his forces mobilized and ready to his
hand.</p>

<p>Moreover, the interview with Wygram had brought
home to the Colossus that the police, whom he heartily
despised and was ever ready to defy, were far better
informed than himself on this dark subject. For once
the U. P. secret service, one of his own pet creations,
had been outshone. He had Wygram to thank for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
that. Rumor had not overpainted the powers of a remarkable
man. In spite of the charlatan&#8217;s mantle,
which after all might be only a cloak to deceive the
unwary, this man had a curious but undeniable faculty.
It must be the aim of the U. P. to turn it later to full
account.</p>

<p>Saul Hartz made no difference in his way of life.
And under duress he was moved to an act of reparation
in the matter of John Endor. True, the <i>amende</i> was
tardy, not to say grudging, yet offered so skilfully as
to rob it of any such appearance.</p>

<p>The U. P. freely circulated Mr. Endor&#8217;s contradiction.
It ate in public as much humble pie as was consistent
with a sense of dignity. The <i>Planet</i>, that
high-toned newspaper associated itself with this belated
apology to Mr. Endor, but at the same time covered
its tracks in its own inimitable fashion, by drawing a
moral and adorning a tale. A trivial episode in the
career of a minor politician had already had more attention
paid to it than its nature called for in these
strenuous days!</p>

<p>In regard to Helen Sholto, new difficulties arose.
She had declined on any terms to take charge of the
new journal for women. It had not been easy to make
up her mind, since none knew better than she what a
prize she was giving up. Nor was it easy for Saul
Hartz to yield to this decision. A man of imperious
will, the habit of gratifying it had become second nature.
For once, however, he had gone the wrong way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
to work. He had counted on being able, in the last
resort, to force the hand of an ambitious and brilliant
woman. When squarely put to a choice between a
ruined John Endor and a triumphant U. P. with the
advantages of the one, and the disabilities of the other
in the scale, he felt pretty sure that common sense must
gain the day.</p>

<p>That it had not done so was annoying. He had the
highest opinion of this young woman. Emphatically
she was beginning to count with her own sex. An
agile pen, a clear perception, a quick tongue, a fine
presence were winning an ever-growing authority on
the lecture platform and in the press. Maker and unmaker
of reputations, as the Colossus secretly flattered
himself that he was, it went to his heart that one to
whom he was ready to offer a crown should cross over
to the camp of a weak and insignificant enemy&mdash;an
enemy who, in point of fact, was already broken.</p>

<p>Moreover, she had resigned her position in the Office.
That she was still there was because Saul Hartz
was entitled to claim due notice of the termination of
the contract. But there was no open breach in their
relations. Even if his misprison was as grave as John
Endor declared it to be, and now that Helen&#8217;s eyes
were open, all things conspired to make the fact more
credible, she could not forget the past, nor could she
quite overcome the curious power of the man himself.</p>

<p>Much was about to happen to John and Helen, and
to this subtle foe who was bent on the destruction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the one, and who, besides, was fully determined that
the other should be made to serve his will. Ten days
passed, however, without a hint of the cards that destiny
was about to play. In the Office things went on
as usual. Saul Hartz was inclined to believe&mdash;like
the Iron Duke he was in a situation much exposed to
fools he always said&mdash;that the mandate from the Council
of Seven was a hoax and that there would be no
developments, when the time came to keep his week-end
engagement at Doe Hill.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ON Saturday afternoon Saul Hartz left London
by the 3:20 from Paddington. It was a
long and full train and the Colossus whose habit was to
travel <i>en prince</i> whenever possible, had, in spite of all
that his equerry could do, to share a carriage with other
passengers. Slight attention was paid to these. Acutely
observant on occasion of the world around him he
could also be the reverse. And now as he entered
the compartment and took the seat that had been retained
for him in the corner next the door, he gave to
his fellow travelers, of whom there were three, a glance
so perfunctory that it told nothing. He proceeded to
immerse himself in a memoir of a publicist lately dead
whom he had intimately known. It amused him to
compare his own estimate of the man with that presented
to the world in this official biography.</p>

<p>When the train stopped at Slough, two of the other
occupants of the carriage got out, leaving the one who
remained in the corner farthest from Saul Hartz. At
first, the Colossus paid him no more attention than before,
but as the train began to move out of the station,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
he chanced to look up from the book whose na&iuml;vet&eacute;
had palled already, and suddenly caught the eye of his
fellow traveler.</p>

<p>It was the eye of John Endor.</p>

<p>The two men had a nodding acquaintance with each
other. All the personalities of the time were known
to Saul Hartz. He went everywhere, he rubbed
shoulders continually with the celebrated, the notorious,
in fact with all the members of that heterogeneous
body who from whatever cause are large in the public
eye. John Endor was not yet forty but he was a figure
already in the life of the time.</p>

<p>The Colossus never forgot a face. And he never
forgot any material fact that was involved in the process
of recognition. His glance was held at once, less
by John Endor than by an ugly bruise above the right
eye. Seeing it, he gave a slight start. Involuntarily
his gaze fell to the eyes beneath, and again he started,
this time, at their look of open, implacable enmity.</p>

<p>Saul Hartz smiled. On all occasions his power of
recovery was automatic. As became one who saw
himself as a modern dictator, he allowed nothing to
come between the wind and his nobility.</p>

<p>The eyes of John Endor would have quelled a lesser
man. They merely goaded the Colossus into action.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if we are going to the same place.&#8221; Hartz&#8217;s
voice, which seldom rose above a husky wheeze and
yet had the power of carrying a great distance, had a
note of half insolent <i>bonhomie</i>. It had, too, the complacence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
of one who does not disguise that he has sized
up all things in the visible universe. Not for him the
irritating reserves, the conventional glosses of &#8220;the
English gentleman.&#8221; Sublime faith in himself and a
stupendous power of will enabled him to ride straight
at every obstacle in his path. He knew that he could
and would surmount it.</p>

<p>No answer having greeted his remark, the Colossus
slowly repeated it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hartz?&#8221; The tentativeness of John Endor
was emphasized by a quick fall of the eyelids.</p>

<p>The owner of the <i>Planet</i> smiled affirmatively. &#8220;My
first visit to Doe Hill,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A beautiful Tudor
house, I&#8217;m told. I suppose you know it well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been there several times.&#8221; Endor&#8217;s cold politeness
let it be seen that he was not in a mood to talk.
&#8220;Shakespeare and the musical glasses.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colossus, however, declined to be put off. He
had things to say to this man, and he was going to
say them. Between the two was an antagonism that
was absolutely deadly, but so well was each versed in
the rules of the game that a third person not sharing
their grim secret could never have guessed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;ll be there?&#8221; said Hartz in a light tone.</p>

<p>Endor was unable to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our dear Helen Sholto for one, perhaps.&#8221; The
genial voice was full of charm.</p>

<p>John Endor believed not. And to hear that name
on the lips of the man opposite was a little more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
he could bear. He let down the window with a jerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, congratulations&mdash;hearty congratulations.&#8221;
The husky wheeze floating across the compartment
seemed to grow more virile. &#8220;A lucky&mdash;a
very lucky fellow. I hope you know&mdash;but of course,
you <i>do</i> know&mdash;what a prize&mdash;an altogether exceptional
prize&mdash;you have drawn in the lottery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor returned icy thanks. With all the aristocrat&#8217;s
power of defending himself at close quarters, he
began to feel that the man opposite was too much for
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221;&mdash;the Colossus was almost like a kitten
with a skein of wool&mdash;&#8220;I shall always owe you a
grudge for stealing her from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gentle, half amused as were the words, behind them
was a glint of steel. Endor, in spite of a disciplined
will, could not resist its challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite a pretty way of putting it,&#8221; he said. And
there was a nip in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Rien qui blesse comme la verit&eacute;.</i>&#8221; The laugh of
the Colossus had now a singular lack of music. &#8220;Helen
Sholto was my right hand, my other self almost. She
understood my ways. I don&#8217;t know what I shall do
without her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor had only a conventional regret to offer for
having robbed his enemy of so rare a treasure. He
may have felt that the note of lamentation was pitched
dangerously high, or again, knowing this man for what
he was, he may have been seeking a motive behind it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>The Colossus, however, with an odd concentration
of voice and eye, went on developing the theme in his
own peculiar manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was everything to me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just&mdash;everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somehow that husky wheeze put John in mind of a
Californian rattler he had heard more than once in his
travels. It now struck right home to his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is a big word.&#8221; He tried to keep his
voice level, but restrain himself as he might he was
beginning to see red.</p>

<p>&#8220;A big word&mdash;yes&mdash;I agree.&#8221; The wheeze became
a snarl of subtle contempt. &#8220;But in this case it&#8217;s the
only one you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen&#8217;s lover had an illusion of fangs striking his
flesh.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he demanded with savage
eyes.</p>

<p>Saul Hartz shrugged contemptuously and spread his
hands like a stage Frenchman.</p>

<p>In the vain hope of freeing his veins of a poison,
Endor repeated a futile question. With a skill, in itself
a mockery, his enemy tossed it lightly into the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it better in some cases,&#8221; he said, picking each
word with the fetid delicacy of a Baudelaire, &#8220;to leave,
my dear friend, just a little to the imagination?&#8221;</p>

<p>The words in the ear of John Endor were those of a
devil. He could but gasp. There was no mistaking
their implication. Looking squarely across at the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
seated in the far corner of the carriage, he saw the
image of one capable of doing evil for the love of it.
A monster of wickedness confronted him. But in this
moment of suffering, his thought was less of the woman
he loved than of the country he adored. By what
cruel turn of Fate&#8217;s shuttle had she, the conqueror of
half the world, been conquered by antichrist himself?</p>

<p>This secret power behind the great movements of
the time, this framer of policies, foreign and domestic,
this boss of all bosses, this big serpent who swallowed
the little serpents, what a commentary he was on the
world that he governed! Was it possible, that in the
act of recoil from the highest moment in her history,
Civilization should now be in bondage to a mere beast!</p>

<p>Still looking at the hooded eyes of the man opposite,
a strange light came into those of John Endor. As
in a glass darkly he saw the final degradation, the ultimate
doom of the thing he loved beyond all other
things. &#8220;One with Nineveh and Tyre.&#8221; How often
had antichrist, and with what a gusto, blazoned these
words in the pages of his own newspapers. He even
printed them in Greek on appropriate occasions. Cynicism
raised to this power was the perquisite of no
common man.</p>

<p>Man he hardly seemed to be as there he sat, looking
at the light in the face of John Endor and yet characteristically
heedless of its cause. Truly, the mind
becomes subdued to that in which it works! Having,
with his insight into modern mechanical conditions, bemused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the five continents of the world by diabolonian
arts, he saw himself now with the world at his feet,
and in his grasp all the strings of the U. P.&mdash;that latter-day
symbol of the supreme power.</p>

<p>Endor might well despair of his country. A sort
of blind fury swept him as the thought of its impotence
flooded his mind. Sheer force of will was needed to
choke back that tide of rage. The man opposite, reading
his heart like a page of news tensed his muscles,
held himself ready. Even if the true cause of Endor&#8217;s
violence was not yet revealed to Saul Hartz, he knew
that he had goaded to the breaking point one whose
nerves were overstrung.</p>

<p>The Colossus, however, was not afraid. He was
ready for Endor&#8217;s expected onset. Of powerful physique,
in the prime of manhood, he neither smoked nor
drank too much; he rode two hours daily and in youth
he had studied the arts of self-defense under the best
masters.</p>

<p>Let this mad fool come on! He would find waiting
for him a pretty old-fashioned customer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HAPPILY for the credit of two distinguished men,
the train began at once to slow up and Dowling
Junction came in view. This chanced to be the station
for Doe Hill. Saul Hartz opened the carriage
door promptly and got out. Endor got out too.</p>

<p>Outside, in the station yard, three private motors
awaited the train&#8217;s arrival. Others of the week-end
party were clearly expected. One man, in point of
fact, was already in conversation with the chauffeur
of the first vehicle by the time Hartz and Endor arrived
on the scene. This man, tall and arresting, with
the open, alert look of the best type of American,
would have been a striking figure anywhere. George
Hierons by name, his reputation had spread already
through two hemispheres as that of an audaciously
progressive thinker; one of a chosen band of pioneers
in the world of mind whom many conceived likely
to revolutionize modern conditions, social, economic
and industrial.</p>

<p>As soon as Endor saw the dominant figure of George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Hierons he went straight up to him and with an impulsiveness
delightfully frank, grasped his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how good&mdash;how very
good to see you! When did you reach this country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten days ago,&#8221; said Hierons, shaking hands cordially.</p>

<p>Saul Hartz, who had met Hierons more than once
in New York, came up also with a salutation. The
proffered hand, however, was declined by the American,
who significantly turned aside to greet a remarkable
personage who at that moment, with slow dignity,
was approaching the little group round the first motor.
A grave and reverend Celestial, gorgeous in a jacket
of yellow brocade, and the regalia of a high and exclusive
order of his race, exchanged a low bow with
George Hierons. The American at once presented
John Endor to this dignitary, but the controller of the
U. P., although he pressed forward for the obvious
purpose of being included in this ceremony, was left
out in the cold. There could be no mistaking the icy
antagonism with which both men regarded him; there
could be no mistaking that such an emotion was fully
shared by John Endor. The manner in which all three
moved towards the door of the second motor, leaving
Saul Hartz stranded high and dry in sole possession
of the first, seemed to drive the fact home.</p>

<p>The Colossus, aware that a public affront had been
given him, turned upon his heel not without a hint
of disdain. His bearing as he entered the first car,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
alone, was calm indifference. He cared for none, he
feared none; moreover, he prided himself upon his
power of wiping off old scores and paying grudges
with interest. The car waited a minute or two to give
other arrivals an opportunity of joining him. None
did so; and the first of the three cars started for Doe
Hill with Saul Hartz its sole occupant.</p>

<p>As it began to move, there flashed across the mind
of the Colossus the warning of the man Wygram in
regard to Lien Weng, the Chinese occultist. And it
came upon him now with the force of a definite action.
Instantly he knew, without a shade of doubt, that he
was in the toils of the Society of the Friends of Peace.
Even for one of Saul Hartz&#8217;s iron nerve, such an intuition
was not agreeable. Too much was known of
the activities of the Council of Seven, its far-reaching
yet dark power had been too recently demonstrated for
such a fact to be lightly held.</p>

<p>Saul Hartz lit a cigar and then gave careful thought
to a decidedly unpleasant situation. What should he do?</p>

<p>Uppermost, for a moment, was an instinct to tell
the chauffeur to drive him back to the station, so that
he might return to London by the next train. Only
a madman or a fool would walk open-eyed into a den
of declared enemies, particularly when they bore the
indelible brand of fanatics and murderers.</p>

<p>There was nothing of the weakling, however, about
Saul Hartz. He could never have reached his present
significance in the scheme of things had there been any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
taint of will. Less than half a good cigar was needed
to convince him that flight would serve no purpose.
Besides, what direct evidence was there? And even
if the case was as he feared, soon or late the music
would have to be faced. Such an organization, in the
light of evidence his own private agents had laboriously
collected during the past two years, was too powerful
for one of its chosen victims to thwart it by running
away and hiding his head in sand.</p>

<p>At the back of everything, moreover, and in the
last resort was the <i>&eacute;lan vital</i> of the born fighter. Saul
Hartz loved danger for its own sake. War, in the
inmost fiber of his nature, was the sweetest of all mistresses.
He was the last man in the world to yield
to a mere threat.</p>

<p>Let this <i>Vehmgericht</i> do its worst!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE reception of the Colossus by the ch&acirc;telain of
Doe Hill was instinct with charm. Rose Carburton,
as accomplished a hostess as the Old World could
show, had the art of shining like a rare jewel in an
exquisite setting. And hers the imperious magnetism
to which all men yield. Highly sexed, a siren, an enchantress,
she never forgot in mid-career the painfully
difficult lessons learned in early youth.</p>

<p>Ridden by no sect, truckling to no class, Rose Carburton
cast her net wide. The widow of a man of
fabulous wealth, one of her ambitions had been to make
Doe Hill the most interesting house in Britain. This
she was in a fair way to achieve. At any rate, the
representative few of many diverse worlds were glad
to visit this famous trysting place to meet their kind.</p>

<p>The party for the week-end was not large but it had
been chosen with care. Comprising eight men and
four women, at dinner they mustered thirteen. Although
the hostess jested gayly, Saul Hartz in his
present frame of mind was not proof altogether against
the omen. Casting a dubious eye along the table he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
scrutinized his fellow guests. His gaze was caught
at once by the ascetic visage of Lien Weng. The Celestial
in the magnificent robes of a high order of
mandarins was an awe-inspiring figure. Such a man
seemed to bear the centuries on his brow and in the
deep lines of an impassive face. He spoke little, but
his English was choice, with hardly a trace of accent;
his every word was ripe, his every gesture pregnant
with meaning.</p>

<p>Seated next but one to Lien Weng was an old gray-bearded
Hindu, the famous sage and philosopher Bandar
Ali. The controller of the Universal Press, who
plumed himself justly on the encyclopedic nature of his
mind, knew this old man as one whose name was familiar
throughout the East. Opposite was Roland
Holles, a combination almost unique, of poet, sportsman,
publicist, seer, Kentish squire, and member of
an old family who scandalized his relations and alienated
his friends by a rooted antagonism to the British
Empire. On the right of the hostess was De Tournel,
<i>litterateur</i> and <i>homme du monde</i>, unsparing critic of
all religions and most advanced of thinkers; on her
left was Hierons the American. The other men at
the table were John Endor and El Santo, the Spanish
mystic.</p>

<p>The women, even with the hostess left out, were
hardly less interesting; the venerable Marchesa della
Gardia who had spent a long life fighting for Italy;
the awe-inspiring Madame Kornileff who had braved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
Siberia for her opinions; Pauline Verdet, widow of
the great chemist who so recently had discovered a
new element and had forfeited his life in the process;
and Ethel Bergman, a woman of vast possessions, only
child of a great inventor who had inherited much of
her father&#8217;s genius. These people, seated dourly round
that solemn mahogany, were a company whose significance
even a house with the traditions of Doe Hill
could seldom, if ever, have equaled.</p>

<p>To a man like Saul Hartz, the range of whose information
allowed him to know exactly who these persons
were and what they stood for, such a gathering
was in itself a portent. So formidable was its collective
effect that for once his habitual self-confidence
threatened to desert him. As revealed by the tempered
rays of the softly shaded candles, there was something
sinister in those twelve faces.</p>

<p>The talk at the dinner table ministered to this impression.
There was little of the light give and take,
of the cheerful wit, of the loosing of the voice
for the love of hearing it, peculiar to these occasions.
Low tones embodied words weighty and considered;
all seemed preoccupied with large issues, grave things.</p>

<p>Saul Hartz was soon alive to the fact that he was
rather being given the cold shoulder. In such a picked
company of intellectuals, even he might expect to feel
a little out of it. Such indeed was his sense of isolation
that several times that evening the Colossus was
fain to ask himself why he had been invited to meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
these people. And for his severely logical mind there
could be only one answer.</p>

<p>He could have wished that he had not come. All
the same, the love of adventure was rooted in him.
And deep in his heart was the arrogance of one who
knows that he has the master-key to human nature.
No matter how imposing its airs, human nature can
never be more than itself, an affair of pygmies. In
relation to others, even if they comprised the world&#8217;s
flower, he saw himself a giant. So far, he had carried
everything to victory. All that he handled turned
to gold. His was the Midas touch. Let those cranks
and visionaries do their worst. He did not fear them;
he did not fear mortal men. And they would do well
to look to themselves. As controller of that amazing
engine, the Universal Press, Saul Hartz firmly believed
that he wielded the mightiest power of the
modern world.</p>

<p>If the atmosphere of the dining room had been heavy
to the verge of the baleful, that of the ancient library,
whither the men retired with their coffee and cigars, was
no less suffocating. Hartz&#8217;s educated palate had been
regaled with a <i>cordon bleu</i> and vintage wines, the
brandy was old and the cigars not unworthy of it, but,
in spite of these things, he was unable to throw off the
feeling that a sword was hanging over his head. Somehow,
the other seven men held intercourse in a language
to which he had not a key. Their words were
few and fragmentary, but they held esoteric meanings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
As the time passed, Hartz&#8217;s conviction grew
that these men were assembled for a dark purpose.
When at last he decided to look for consolation elsewhere,
his withdrawal from the library seemed to provoke
a keen sense of relief.</p>

<p>It was ten o&#8217;clock. He sought the ladies in various
stately rooms, but already they appeared to have gone
to bed. Thoroughly depressed by now, the Colossus
felt that he could not do better than follow this example.</p>

<p>His bedroom was at the end of a long cavernous-looking
corridor. The room was large, magnificently
upholstered and full of Louis Seize furniture, an apartment,
in fact, which <i>le grand monarque</i> himself might
have condescended to sleep in. Yet, to the senses of
its present occupant, now so acutely strung, it gave a
feeling of the uncanny. Shadows lurked round the
canopied bed; in spite of the thick carpet, the floor
seemed a thing of echoes as he walked across it; the
great shutters of the windows with their look of medieval
solidity might have hid some magic casement;
above all, the dark lights springing from the black
oak paneling were weird and strange. None knew
better than Saul Hartz how to ride imagination on the
curb, yet as he slowly and rather unwillingly undressed,
he felt that in such a room anything might happen.</p>

<p>Impatient with himself he switched off the light and
got into bed. But never had he felt so little like sleep.
Something was afoot in this old house. Just what it
was he could not say, and yet he was sure it concerned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
him intimately. His mind was a nest of fancies. The
second glass of port might have been a mistake, or the
oysters might have upset him, for by some means, the
room in which he lay was now alive with the evil
spirit of the Middle Ages. Who knew what black arts,
what latent devilries lurked behind its tapestry? Would
this ancient bed in which he felt so uncomfortable be
let down into a secret vault wherein a <i>Vehmgericht</i>
was assembled? Would these mysterious walls recede
to disclose a Secret Council in session? Lying impotently
there, his mind grew morbid. He was almost
tempted to ring for his servant that he might have
company.</p>

<p>What was in the wind? Downstairs in the library
something was afoot. The frigid politeness of his
fellow guests returned to him with new meaning. All
these people, men and women alike, nobly and variously
gifted as they were, had a taint of fanaticism. It was
idle to deny that he was lying in the midst of danger.</p>

<p>A man of less force might have been tempted to
blame his own folly in lying there at all. But Saul
Hartz neither repined nor looked back. All experience
was good. This was a real adventure. Besides
having at last fallen foul of this precious Society, soon
or late he would have to face it. So far as he was
concerned, it might as well be now. He knew the grim
record of the Council of Seven, but he would not
swerve an inch from the course already prescribed for
himself. It should not be easy to terrorize Saul Hartz.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
And even if life itself was the stake, was life, after all,
such a very great matter?</p>

<p>Lying there, with sleep far from his pillow, he
sought to arrange his mind and put his affairs in order.
He felt it likely that he would never leave that room
alive, but the premonition did not lessen his scorn of
others. For that remorseless mind there could be no
hereafter. The position he took up was that of a
philosopher known to the recent past: &#8220;He knew
there had been one ice age, and he believed there was
going to be another.&#8221; A bundle of primal instincts,
he merely followed his appetites.</p>

<p>Saul Hartz had an appetite for power. Up till the
very moment of entering that room he had considered
himself beyond good and evil. But as he lay, waves
of thought leaped upon him from those walls. Conspiracy
was in the air. Certain forces meant to break
him. And how easy to achieve. A drop of poison in
a cup of coffee, a knife, or a pistol shot, a knock on
the head in the dark, a push, neatly timed, onto a live
rail of the Underground, and all would be over. So
far as the Colossus was concerned, that would be the
end. Let it be so. After all, he had read the Riddle
of the Sphinx. Knowing all, there was nothing to
know.</p>

<p>He pressed a button of his devil&#8217;s machine, and wheat
rose five shillings a bushel in Europe; he pressed another
button, and half a continent was removed from the
comity of nations. But what did it matter? In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
sight of Saul Hartz the planet Earth was but a grain
of sand on the tideway of eternity. Organic life was
a negation of a negation, yet from the first, he had been
ready to pay a full price for supreme power. But now
it had come to him, it wrought no appeasement of the
cosmic sense. Man he was and man he must remain.</p>

<p>It was probable that he was entering upon his last
hours, but he made no oblation to a God in which he
did not believe. Pursuing the laws of reason with
remorseless logic, he had made of himself a god. At
the dawn of consciousness he had seen the self in pictures,
till now, at the threshold of the night of time,
he saw himself as antichrist. His brain, as he had
always known, was adapted just a little better to the
modern one-hell-of-a-muss than that of any other adventurous
insect. It enabled him to get, with a minimum
of effort, all the things he sought in the material
world. They did not bring happiness, but he did not
look for it. Such an abortion as man had no claims
to beatitude. For man in his very nature was a hybrid,
a contradiction, a grotesque in whom the elements must
be ever at war. Let him never seek peace on earth,
and as far as heaven was concerned, granting that it
existed, what a place of exquisite boredom it must be!</p>

<p>Long hours the Colossus lay searching his heart and
then, finally, he drew the bedclothes over his head and
decided to go down fighting. To go down fighting&mdash;that
would be the ultimate bliss for one who made no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
terms with life. After all, the lust for power was
greater than the will to live.</p>

<p>Lying there, hour after hour, in the uncanny silence
of that room, the conviction had grown until now it
enfolded him like the arms of a woman, that the sleep
upon which he was about to enter would be his last.
This brief but intense review of experience had pierced
him so deeply that it began to seem certain that the end
was now near.</p>

<p>At last, he fell into a doze. But hardly had consciousness
left him, when, with a violent start, he
awoke. Somebody had entered the room. The electric
light next the door had been switched on. He
sat up in bed to confront a face drawn and haggard,
and a pair of eyes somber, ruthless, terrible.</p>

<p>They were the eyes of John Endor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">FOR a space of ten seconds or so, the two men stared
at one another. And then Saul Hartz, once more
the human animal, took himself strongly in hand.</p>

<p>Automatically his fists clenched. A revolver ...
a knife ... a corrosive acid ... unless he sprang
at once he would not be given a chance to get one in
before the <i>Vehmgericht</i> put up his number!</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon!&#8221; The intruder&#8217;s polite voice
came not an instant too soon. &#8220;If I have disturbed
you I am sorry. I thought this was my room. It must
be next door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An easy mistake to make in the dark.&#8221; Almost at
once Saul Hartz was in full command of the situation.</p>

<p>Endor prepared to withdraw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Off to bed late, aren&#8217;t you? What&#8217;s the time?&#8221;
The Colossus looked at his watch. &#8220;Nearly a quarter
to four.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surprise flashed across Endor&#8217;s dark face. &#8220;So late!&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Given up to high-brow talk down below, eh?&#8221;
Hartz&#8217;s cold laugh did not try to conceal the sneer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
behind it. &#8220;Setting the affairs of the universe in order,
I daresay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer of John Endor was icy, venomous, slow.
&#8220;Of the <i>Planet</i> at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; said the Colossus. &#8220;One guessed your program
was ambitious. Maybe you&#8217;ll find the affairs
of the <i>Planet</i> a pretty tough problem, my friend.&#8221; And
there was a challenge in his voice and in his eyes.</p>

<p>Endor&#8217;s face grew darker. &#8220;No doubt,&#8221; he said
aloofly. And then, without another word, he turned
abruptly and lurched a little unsteadily out of the room.
As he did so he switched off the light.</p>

<p>The Colossus was able to get an hour or two of
troubled sleep. But it was disturbed by bad dreams.
Take it altogether it was perhaps the least agreeable
night he had ever spent. The arrival of his servant
at eight o&#8217;clock with tea and shaving water came as a
real relief. Never had daylight been quite so welcome.
But it was a prelude to a day of tedium broken
now and then by moments of acute embarrassment.
The other men continued to keep him at arm&#8217;s length,
and he was at no pains to disguise that he fully reciprocated
their feelings. Besides, much of their time
seemed to be passed in anxious conclave, of which,
although conducted in secret with all the privacy of
closed doors, he was not slow to guess the nature.</p>

<p>As far as the women were concerned, he did not get
on much better. His hostess, a creature of rare accomplishment
and charm, was not at all at ease in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
brief and fragmentary conversations with him. By
the others he was frankly bored. They belonged to
the pure milk of the intellectual. Disdaining the feminine
arts altogether, they had that rather distressing
mental acuteness of which men of equal or superior
caliber are apt to fight very shy.</p>

<p>It occurred to Saul Hartz, as soon as luncheon was
over, that his wisest course in the circumstances would
be to return at once to town. Sorely was he tempted
to this, but to begin with there was no Sunday train,
and even if a motor could be obtained, the journey was
considerably more than a hundred miles. It would be
an affront, moreover, to the hostess, although perhaps
the Colossus was the last man in the world with whom
a consideration of that kind was likely to weigh.</p>

<p>But when all was said, what really enabled Saul
Hartz to face another day of Doe Hill was the situation
itself. The feeling obsessed him that something
was about to happen. And whatever the something
might be, he was not the man to shirk it.</p>

<p>The day wore on, however, and nothing occurred.
Grim faces, hostile looks were on every hand, but they
did not culminate in any overt act. And the hostess
with her immense social experience was able to ease
the tension a little. But the Colossus provided a rare
test for her powers. He seldom opened his heart to a
woman. And with bitter enemies on every side, he
retired very much into his shell. Howbeit, even he
could not resist the allure of Rose Carburton. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
so very much a woman of the world that in the course
of the day, as the crown of many attempts, she made
some impact upon a reserve that was indeed formidable.</p>

<p>After tea, while she was showing him a rare collection
of miniatures, it suddenly occurred to Saul Hartz
that through the medium of this woman there might be
a hope of getting a line as to the Society&#8217;s attitude
towards himself. Some hint, also, might be forthcoming
of the course it was likely to follow.</p>

<p>Characteristically, he began by asking point blank
if she were a member of it. She fenced adroitly, with
infinite wit in the use of the foils, but he pressed her
hard. He meant to have the truth; and the sense of
its importance her dexterity confessed nerved him to
tear it from her. Force of reasoning took it captive
in the end, not that the penetration of a Solomon was
called for in the process.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what, pray, do you think you are going to
achieve with your mumbo jumbo?&#8221; he asked, suddenly
spinning the button off his foil. &#8220;It is wrong in ethics,
it stands outside the law, it is an affront to religion, it
is opposed to the deepest instincts of the human race.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carburton said cautiously that the rules of the
Society did not permit its case to be argued. But its
members sincerely believed that by fearless co&ouml;perative
action they could do permanent good to the world.</p>

<p>Saul Hartz took leave to doubt it. And to kill a
man because one did not happen to agree with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
opinions, gloss it over as one might, was simple murder.</p>

<p>&#8220;But does it kill people?&#8221; said Mrs. Carburton, with
a slow and steady widening of fine gray eyes.</p>

<p>Was this real innocence? Or did she merely think
him a fool? His stern eyes questioned her candid
ones, but they told him nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;In effect,&#8221; said Saul Hartz brutally, &#8220;this Society
is a murder club. Barely a fortnight ago the unfortunate
Garland was done to death by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A coroner&#8217;s jury,&#8221; said Rose Carburton, &#8220;declared
William Garland&#8217;s death to be from an unknown cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cause is not unknown to the Council of Seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not belong to the Council,&#8221; said Rose Carburton
simply. &#8220;No woman does. But speaking as
an ordinary member of society&mdash;we&#8217;ll dispense with
the &#8216;the&#8217;&mdash;from the bottom of my heart I rejoice that
a man so infamous as William Garland is no longer
able to do harm to his fellow creatures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Infamous is a strong word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No man ever won a better right to it than William
Garland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can only know that by hearsay&mdash;even granting,
as one may&mdash;that Garland was a thoroughly &#8216;bad hat.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose Carburton smiled faintly and shook a mournful
head. &#8220;On the contrary, William Garland had a
trial long, full and fair, if ever man had. Evidence
was collected and most carefully weighed, and it was
proven beyond a doubt that Garland&#8217;s aim was to set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
class against class. By making the world no place for
honest and peaceful folk to live in, he hoped to become
a sort of glorified Trotzky or Lenin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And on these vague grounds a fortuitous body of
persons takes upon itself to murder him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a matter in which one is only too glad to
remain in ignorance,&#8221; said Rose Carburton. &#8220;But at
least one realizes,&#8221; she fervently added, &#8220;that the world
is a sweeter and cleaner place now that Garland is no
longer in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be so,&#8221; said Saul Hartz sternly. &#8220;On that
point I offer no opinion. But who and what, pray, is
this Society, that it should arrogate to itself the right to
take these extreme measures?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is composed,&#8221; said Rose Carburton, &#8220;of the ablest,
the most disinterested, the most humane minds of all
countries, and, as I understand, it has one object in
view and one object alone&mdash;to conserve by every means
in its power the peace of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saul Hartz laughed contemptuously. &#8220;As though
by carrying on a private vendetta, it can do anything
of the kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not aim at reprisal. Personal animus has
no place in the scheme. In sum it is the last resort,
the Final Court of Appeal of the Weak against the
Strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sheer anarchy,&#8221; said Saul Hartz. &#8220;It is subversive
of every law of God and Man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose Carburton held her ground bravely. &#8220;It is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
heroic attempt to adjust the balance of power. Certain
minds in the world of public affairs&mdash;and it is only
one world among many&mdash;are now in full control of
the wires which hold society together. These minds
stand for negation. At the beck of private ambition
of an ignoble kind, they are prepared to override all
that is human, all that is divine. So long as they can
fill the world with war and the rumor of war they
thrive. In the end, of course, Fate itself will deal with
them, but only at an awful cost to the helpless and the
innocent. Had society had the power in 1912 to remove
Wilhelm II and the small group of men around
him, it is almost certain that the cataclysm which has
so nearly destroyed the civilization of the West would
have been averted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saul Hartz took leave to doubt it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">DINNER that evening was again a cheerless meal.
It was hard to say why. All that wealth, discriminating
taste, the social arts could devise was
there in profusion. There was an absence of ceremony.
Taken as individuals nothing could have exceeded
the personal attraction of those who graced the
famous Doe Hill mahogany, but in a subtle way and for
some hidden reason they refused to coalesce.</p>

<p>Some of the foremost minds of the world had come
together. On a normal occasion the talk of such people
must have been copious, salt, full of marrow; this evening
it was tentative, halting, spineless; the hearts and
minds of the speakers were too plainly not in it.</p>

<p>A skeleton was at the feast. Of that fact Saul Hartz
was fully aware. From the moment of arrival the
previous day a deadly sense of being in the enemy&#8217;s
camp had oppressed him. All that had happened
since, outwardly unimportant though it was, had ministered
to it. Each one of these people, even the
hostess herself seemed, so far as possible, to avoid
him. They were forever looking the other way; even
in moments of unavoidable intercourse he felt an odd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
constraint. And this evening, in spite of the <i>mise en
scene</i>, an almost positive sense of disharmony reached
a climax. Course by course the conversation waned.
By the time the meal was at an end, silence hung like
a pall over the whole table.</p>

<p>When the ladies left the room, the eight men who
remained were conscious of a momentary lifting of
the cloud. But they stayed only a short time circulating
the decanters. A move was made once more to
that wonderful room, the library, whose walls had been
furnished so liberally with the world&#8217;s wisdom, for the
most part in bindings choice and rare. The somber
magnificence of the drawn curtains, the soft radiance
of the candelabra, the glow from the open hearth, lent
to the scene an austere dignity that was felt by all.
Coffee and cigars, and even the fine liqueurs which were
promptly dispensed, came almost as a desecration to
such a sacramental atmosphere.</p>

<p>Less than five minutes after the servants had gone,
Lien Weng gave a quiet signal. The American, George
Hierons, and the Frenchman de Tournel rose abruptly
from their chairs and proceeded at once to lock the
two doors of the room. With a ceremonious bow they
handed the keys to Lien Weng.</p>

<p>The Chinaman turned to face Saul Hartz. &#8220;Sir, the
Court is now constituted,&#8221; he said without a trace of
emotion. His English was perfect, but there was a
curiously soft inflection in the low voice.</p>

<p>Saul Hartz, defiance in his air, merely shrugged contemptuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
shoulders. Every sense keenly strung, he
had been apprised by this overt act even before it came.</p>

<p>&#8220;My good friends have done me the honor,&#8221; Lien
Weng continued in a voice whose timbre was persuasion
itself, &#8220;to invite me to conduct these wholly informal
proceedings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you might add &#8216;wholly illegal&#8217; while you are
about it,&#8221; said the Colossus with a sudden gust of anger.</p>

<p>Lien Weng raised a finger with a gravity verging
upon the pontifical. &#8220;Legal&mdash;illegal&mdash;are words&mdash;words.
This Court&mdash;this Council of Seven deals only
with realities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Golf balls a shilling!&#8221; In order to express an utter
contempt the Colossus spat in the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Words&mdash;phrases!&#8221; The courtesy of a very old civilization
rooted in an immemorial past was in the deep
smile of Lien Weng. &#8220;I ask you, sir, to believe that
as far as this world is concerned we are about to deal
with a matter of life and death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another gust of rage swept Saul Hartz. &#8220;About
to murder me, eh?&#8221; he said savagely, &#8220;as you murdered
Garland the other day, not to mention Kornileff
the Russian, and Yamotoga the Jap, and heaven
knows who besides!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Colossus had spoken he got up from his
chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be seated, pray,&#8221; said Lien Weng with his priest&#8217;s
smile. &#8220;It will be more agreeable for all if you stay
as you were.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>&#8220;If you intend to stick a knife in me and put me
underneath that&#8221;&mdash;Saul Hartz pointed to the yawning
Tudor fireplace which might easily have concealed a
chasm&mdash;&#8220;get through with it at once. I&#8217;m not in a
mood for cat and mouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lien Weng certainly looked feline enough as he narrowed
his eyes and yet distended their pupils. His
subtle face was luminous with meaning. &#8220;You will
be unwise,&#8221; he said simply, &#8220;not to hear all that is
said to you. It is not our wish to go to the extreme.
Sir, your case has received much consideration. It is
our prayer that we may deal with it in the way of
wisdom. I will not add in the way of mercy and
justice, for &#8216;mercy,&#8217; &#8216;justice,&#8217; those too are words, and
the Council of Seven deals only with things. And yet
its every act is governed by the ideals we serve. This
Council is pledged to do the will of the Time-Spirit
with as little suffering or unhappiness to the object of
its attentions as may consist with the high and noble
aim it has in view.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saul Hartz, still standing, folded his arms defiantly.
But the cold force of the speaker was not without effect.
In spite of a bitter and deep hostility the Colossus
was obliged to abate his anger to the point of listening
to every word spoken by this remarkable man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; continued the President of the Council with
the same icy politeness, &#8220;you will do well to know just
what it is that has constituted you the enemy of the
human race. In the fewest possible words I shall hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
to make that clear to you. A man of truly remarkable
gifts, a man of creative imagination in the world
of common affairs, you have so adapted your brain to
the new order evolved by modern civilization that you
have gained control of the sinister machine which
evokes, creates, molds and directs public opinion. That
is a feat of which our Society makes no complaint.
But having acquired by the exercise of your genius
this stupendous power in the physical world, you are
proved to be totally lacking, as was Napoleon, your
prototype before you, in any true or vital sense of the
awful responsibility such a gift confers upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each word of this speech Saul Hartz followed with
care. But as the gravamen of the charge was unfolded,
he took up Lien Weng sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;By what authority,&#8221; he interposed violently, &#8220;are
you and your fellow fanatics&#8221;&mdash;he cast a glance of
savage contempt at the pale, tense faces around him&mdash;&#8220;constituted
your brother&#8217;s keeper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By that same authority,&#8221; said Lien Weng, &#8220;which
confers upon you the power you wield.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever power I may wield,&#8221; said Saul Hartz,
&#8220;has the sanction of the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what law?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The law implicit in the usages of all civilized communities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, there we join issue.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lien Weng looked solemnly at the others. With an
oriental gravity that raised the act to the plane of ritual,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
he took a signet ring from the first finger of his right
hand, for no apparent reason pressed it to his lips and
then put it back again. &#8220;No law,&#8221; he went on in the
same unchanging voice, &#8220;of man&#8217;s contrivance can be
effective unless there lies behind the moral power to
enforce it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you do not realize that you and your
friends, the members of this infamous International
Newspaper Ring, are no longer to be permitted to
carry out the policy for which you stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the policy for which we stand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Giantism&mdash;world-power&mdash;in other words, enslavement
and spoliation of the weak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrant nonsense!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall gain nothing,&#8221; said Lien Weng &#8220;by bandying
words. It has taken the Society of the Friends
of Peace many months to reach a conclusion in this
case of yours; and it has done so only after complete
investigation of all the salient facts. Understand, sir,
that all its verdicts are based upon reason, and that
once moved to action it pursues an undeviating, a relentless
course.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saul Hartz made a gesture of contempt. &#8220;You are
an illegal body. At best you are a murder club. You
stand outside the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not outside the moral law. Take the case of the
teeming, helpless millions of my Chinese compatriots
for whom I speak, of those millions of unlucky creatures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
who know themselves impotent to deal with the
marvelous physical forces now controlled by the western
mind. For months, through the agency of your
terrible engine the Universal Press, you have been inciting
your Government to shatter Peking. For months,
to this end you have been organizing public opinion
by means of false news and distorted facts. Once the
die is cast the yellow and black races are powerless to
cope with the airships, the poison gases, the high explosives,
the dread magics the civilization of the West
is able to hurl upon them. Not a month ago you
caused to be wiped out of existence, by means of bombs
rained from the clouds, a native village in the heart of
Africa. Not a year ago a similar thing occurred in
Afghanistan in Upper India.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would hold me responsible for that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indirectly&mdash;yes. Or to look nearer home, consider
the case of Ireland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The example is not altogether well chosen,&#8221; Saul
Hartz spoke with a scorn he did not try to conceal.
&#8220;If your precious Society will condescend to read our
newspapers, it will see that we are committed to a
policy of conciliation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ireland and her affairs have long been a political
cat&#8217;s-paw for the Newspaper Ring, the secret power
which sways the destinies of mankind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheap generalizations,&#8221; said Saul Hartz, contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Society does not share your view. By the light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
of what has happened since, it now sees that Ireland
and her affairs were a card played with Luciferian
skill to precipitate the world catastrophe. A masterstroke
of policy on the part of antichrist, no doubt.
The scheme was crowned with every success. By the
irony of fate, however, that catastrophe has made it
possible to restore the moral law to the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of which your Society is the embodiment, I presume?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; Lien Weng bowed gravely. &#8220;It is
based entirely on the moral idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; said Saul Hartz, &#8220;it murders
people of whom it doesn&#8217;t approve from the highest
motives. A scheme delightfully convenient, yet not
altogether new.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Society makes no claim to novelty. It has
existed in a rudimentary form in the Celestial Empire
and throughout many Eastern lands for thousands of
years. In the oldest of all existing civilizations it is
the last resort of the weak against the strong. Those
whose minds are developed on disparate lines from
that implacable &#8216;efficiency&#8217; which enables the brain of
the modern western business man to dominate the
physical world and make life a hell for those who
arouse its predatory instincts, are now banded together
in self-defense against the common enemy of
the human race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who and what is the common enemy of the human
race?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>&#8220;Those who contrive war. Those who preach war.
Those who spread rumors of war. The Society has
one aim, and one aim only. By every means in its
power it ensues Peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even at the price of murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Murder is a word, a phrase, determined by the
man-made statutes of a ballot-box democracy, presided
over by the occupant of the Woolsack whom a
supine government failed to hang in the year 19&mdash;&mdash;.
Human nature does not vary in the matter of its law
courts. The man who is hanged is never so finished
a criminal as the man who hangs him. Murder, I
repeat, is a word, a phrase. Peace is tangible, a possible
ideal, a definite object. For many months now,
to give one more instance of its activities, the Universal
Press, of which you, sir, are the controlling
spirit, owing allegiance to none, has been working in
a hundred subterranean ways to embroil the United
States with Great Britain. What it has to gain by
these periodical rifts the stock exchanges of London
and New York are best able to say. But the Universal
Press, whose power is now manifest in every land of
the habitable globe, may yet choose, if unable to surmount
the Trust Law, that bulwark and defense of the
plain American citizen, to involve the two nations in
a fratricidal conflict, with unchallenged world-power
a fitting crown for the victor. Antichrist would then
be indeed enthroned.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colossus again expressed a contempt of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
reasoning. &#8220;Evidently,&#8221; he said in his husky whisper,
&#8220;your precious Society has not condescended to read
the article in yesterday&#8217;s <i>Planet</i> which I myself dictated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me assure you, sir,&#8221; said Lien Weng, &#8220;that
it has done so and marked it carefully. But such admirable
sentiments, of which your newspapers have
an inexhaustible supply, is no more than dust for the
eyes of fools. The Universal Press has taken for its
motto the famous saying of our own Lao-tsze, the
prophet of Taoism, &#8216;Learn to throw dust in order to
cast it.&#8217; Or in words which the western brain may
find easier to understand, &#8216;Learn to defile the wells of
truth behind a curtain of poison gas.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One has heard all this so often,&#8221; said the Colossus,
plaintively. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you tell us something new?&#8221; And
he yawned cavernously in the face of the others.</p>

<p>Lien Weng paid no regard to the interruption. He
went quietly on, &#8220;Much of the political news the Universal
Press transmits so diligently from America to
England is willfully distorted; much of the political
news it transmits from England to America is equally
false.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you say,&#8221; laughed the Colossus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us take one example. The report of the speech
in Congress of Senator Larcom which you print on
page 8 of yesterday&#8217;s <i>Planet</i> is quite inaccurate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Senator Larcom has already sent by cable his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
version of his speech to a member of the Society. You
may read it if you choose, and compare it with the
garbled fragments which appear in the <i>Planet</i> newspaper
and which the Universal Press has already flashed
round the world. At this moment it is being read,
assimilated, acted upon in Hong Kong, Calcutta, Sydney,
Montreal and a hundred-and-one other centers of
public opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a sign from Lien Weng, the cabled account from
Washington was produced by George Hierons, the
person to whom it was sent. It was laid on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read,&#8221; said Lien Weng.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t interest me,&#8221; said the Colossus. &#8220;Besides,
it proves nothing. Mistakes of this kind are
bound to arise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may or may not be so,&#8221; said Lien Weng.
&#8220;But they occur far too often. And as far as Britain
and the United States are concerned they always err
upon one side. That is not the side of amity. Less
than a month ago you put in the mouth of an eminent
English politician a phrase he never used, and sowed
it broadcast. Tardy denial followed, but a calculated
lie had a clear start of seventy-two hours. Infinite
damage has thereby been done to a growing reputation
and to the cause we have at heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a reputation is it, I ask you,&#8221; said
Saul Hartz, insolently, &#8220;that can suffer infinite damage
because a single letter is omitted accidentally from a
single word its owner uses?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;There lies your skill,&#8221; a hoarse voice broke in. It
was that of John Endor. With lustrous eyes and a
face inhuman in its pallor he was following each word
of the argument with intensity. &#8220;All of us here can
only regard it as devilish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;devilish,&#8221; said Lien Weng, in his soft and
gentle voice. &#8220;But even sheer wickedness sometimes
overreaches itself. That simple act of omission, in the
peculiar circumstances of the case, was vile. Yet already
it has had a recoil. The Society of the Friends
of Peace owes to that foul blow the presence here this
evening of John Endor.&#8221; The President bowed gravely
to the politician. &#8220;He will prove a source of infinite
strength to our counsels. We welcome such a man
with open arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>A look of disgust flashed from the eyes of Saul
Hartz. &#8220;A man is not to be envied,&#8221; he said, &#8220;who
mixes himself up with a thing of this kind. If Mr.
Endor is the man I take him to be,&#8221; Hartz looked Endor
steadily in the face, &#8220;he is going to regret very
bitterly his association with you and your fellow anarchists
and murderers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Time alone can prove,&#8221; said Lien Weng impassively,
&#8220;whether John Endor will have anything to
regret in his whole-hearted devotion to the cause of
peace. Meanwhile his presence here cannot fail to
give weight to the deliberations of the Council of
Seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I may say so,&#8221; interposed George Hierons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
&#8220;authority to its acts. Without the help of John Endor
and all that he stands for, the Society might not
have been able to deal with the most inimical power
of the modern world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You pay poor me far too high a compliment,&#8221; said
the Colossus with a down-looking smile. But all present
knew, when they saw it, the pride which apes humility.
&#8220;However, what does it matter?&#8221; With an
air of resignation Saul Hartz folded his arms. &#8220;And
you are getting tedious, aren&#8217;t you? Why not cut the
cackle and get to the hosses? Before you proceed
to nick my throat, or knock me on the head, or dope
my mineral water is there any little thing in which I
can oblige you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are coming, sir, to that.&#8221; The civilized politeness
of Lien Weng was an odd contrast to Saul Hartz&#8217;s
ill-breeding. &#8220;On behalf of the Society I am about to
place before you a formal proposition. It is this: The
Society is prepared to buy your entire holding, including
the Founder&#8217;s shares, in the Universal Press.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to learn your price.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Within three months the Society is prepared to pay
you the sum of two hundred millions sterling. But
to this offer it attaches one condition. You will be
required to give an undertaking never again to engage
in any form whatever of journalistic enterprise. In
other words, sir, you must give up the formidable, nay,
terrible, machine you control, and you are expressly
debarred from ever constructing another one like it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>&#8220;And in the event of this offer being refused?&#8221; Saul
Hartz asked.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence. Lien Weng looked
at the circle of tense faces. But it was the American
who answered the question. As a preliminary he
slowly removed a large cigar from the corner of his
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty bad for the coo, sir,&#8221; he said in a voice like
a child&#8217;s. &#8220;Take it from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect so,&#8221; was Saul Hartz&#8217;s only comment.</p>

<p>Silence came again. The eight men smoked steadily.</p>

<p>Lien Weng it was who spoke at last. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
ask you to make up your mind here and now. You
shall have eight weeks from to-morrow, Monday, in
which to reach a decision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eight weeks. Thank you,&#8221; said the Colossus
dryly. And he began to chew the end of his cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think it over, my friend,&#8221; said Hierons, in a cheerful
and business-like tone. &#8220;One thousand million dollars&mdash;paid
down within three months. Think it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221; The Colossus knocked the ash from the
end of his cigar. &#8220;I promise you that. And now perhaps
you&#8217;ll let me out of this mousetrap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the time being, sir, the business is concluded.&#8221;
And Lien Weng returned the keys of the room to the
Frenchman and the American who promptly unlocked
the doors of the library.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WITHIN the space of the eight weeks granted by
the Society of the Friends of Peace for Saul
Hartz&#8217;s decision, much was to happen to John Endor
and to the inner world of politics in which he moved.
Endor&#8217;s own life was linked so closely with the energies
of the time that the recoil of events affected it
deeply. Many strange, many pregnant, things were
about to happen.</p>

<p>John&#8217;s first act on his return on the Monday to London
from his rather nightmarish visit to Doe Hill was
to communicate at once with Helen Sholto. He arranged
that they should lunch together at a quiet restaurant
in Soho.</p>

<p>Here, in privacy, with none to overhear and none to
oversee, he unburdened his heart. He did not think
well to let Helen know of the Society, much less of
his own transactions with it: how in spite of some
deep protesting instinct, he had been induced to take
the oath of allegiance; how in the main he had yielded
to the powerful arguments of their friend in common,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
George Hierons; and how, having taken the plunge
with a full perception of all that it involved, he was
ready to defend his action. For he now saw with a
clearness greater than ever before, that the malign
growth which was so rapidly eating its way to the core
of the state must, no matter what the cost to the body
politic, be at once cut out.</p>

<p>One thing, however, Endor decided to do. That
was to tell Helen of the charge this man, Saul Hartz,
had laid upon her good name. Such, indeed, was his
real purpose in going to her at once. The impulse of
his nature would not allow him a moment&#8217;s rest until
the woman he loved was rescued from the clutches of
the monster of infamy whom she was loyally serving.</p>

<p>Without preface Endor told her what Saul Hartz
had said.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says you are his mistress.&#8221; As word by word
her ear felt their whispered fall, the surge of emotion
in his voice filled her with pain. Before the blow itself,
however, not a nerve quivered. But her heart turned
to ice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt like killing him. But these are not heroic
days. Besides, such <i>canaille</i> are not worth it&mdash;if one
has a work to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not worth it&mdash;no,&#8221; she said at last, gently, and
then, a woman: &#8220;Tell me, what led him, do you suppose,
to say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pure devilment. He knows you&#8217;re leaving him, he
understands your value, and to give you up to me, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
all people, is for one of his nature a bath of vitriol.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t like him,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;to indulge a
mere spite. He is too big a man. There must have
been a deeper, a subtler motive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think it can be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have reckoned on an outside chance of
your believing what he said.&#8221;</p>

<p>John&#8217;s look of sheer incredulity gave her a sudden
insight into those hidden depths of character she had
yet to penetrate. This new knowledge brought a glow
of light to her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as soon as you have lunched, you
had better go to the telephone and tell them you are
not returning to the Office. Here and now you must
close this man down. You can never go back to Universe
Building.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer at once. Seconds only were
recorded by heart and brain, but when she spoke a
weight of years had been added to her voice. &#8220;I think
you are right,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He could guess the wrench to such a practical mind
as hers to part with her career, to give up with almost
quixotic decision the greatest prize in her profession.
But faced now with the necessity she did not hesitate.
&#8220;I have saved very little,&#8221; she said quite simply. &#8220;And
I don&#8217;t quite see how I am going to get work&mdash;certainly
not immediately, if at all. The U. P. may be able to
close every door. He says they can. However ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
no matter ... there it is. I&#8217;ll go and telephone to
them now.&#8221;</p>

<p>His own will had steeled hers for the task. So
be it! Let the die be cast! But as he sat at the restaurant
table, looking all the facts in the face, the oppression
upon his heart was almost more than he could
bear.</p>

<p>Storm clouds lowered on every hand, heavy with
menace. The future was dark to the verge of the terrible.</p>

<p>As Helen returned, that virile figure, so strong, so
sane, so alive with courage and capacity braced him
for his own great throw.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve cut the painter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now, my darling,&#8221; he said with the odd tenderness
which always made him so hard to resist, &#8220;we
stand together or we fall. Let us get married at once
with the least possible fuss.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not yield at once. Elementally she was very
feminine. Besides, there were strong arguments to
bring against unseemly haste. It would be a bitter blow
to John&#8217;s mother who had quite other views for her
ewe lamb. And what, pray, had they to set up housekeeping
upon, now that Helen had just cast away her
princely thousand dollars a month?</p>

<p>John, however, had given thought to all that. The
old lady, with Helen&#8217;s consent, should stay on at Wyndham
where things might remain exactly as they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
for the rest of her days; and Helen and he could take
a small house in London. At the start, it was true, the
house in London would have to be a very modest affair.
He had a few hundred a year of his own, plus
a few hundred more as a member of parliament; but
now that the U. P. had raised the fiery cross, that
source of revenue would probably disappear at the
next general election, which by all the portents could
not be long delayed. When his mother died he would
have Wyndham and her entire income, which, however,
at the present time was barely sufficient to keep up an
old and much depreciated property.</p>

<p>It would be foolish to shirk the fact that for the
time being they would have to pare cheese. They
would find themselves with their backs to the wall, with
calumny and misrepresentation on every hand; but let
them stand shoulder to shoulder, their colors nailed
to the mast. No matter what happened they would go
down fighting.</p>

<p>The light in his eyes decided Helen. She, too,
belonged to a free people.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll stand or fall together.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grasped, in his boy&#8217;s way, the hand of a good
comrade. &#8220;We&#8217;ll break the International Newspaper
Ring, or it shall break us.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was quite ready to buckle on his armor. &#8220;Government
by newspaper must end&mdash;if civilization is to go
on. One has always smiled at the notion that Saul
Hartz can put in any government he chooses and turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
it out if it doesn&#8217;t please him, but in the last three
weeks one&#8217;s eyes have been opened to many things.
And if the Breit Combine joins with the U. P. as you
declare it will, my own country will be in the same
plight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said John Endor, &#8220;now you really see the
malignant growth that lies at the very root of the
Anglo-Saxon world. There can be no hope of a stable
peace while this king of all grafters is free to go on.
Well, thank God, the eyes of some of us are open at
last. I&#8217;ll go down to the House this afternoon and
air my voice if I get a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All power to it. Meanwhile, I&#8217;ll
go and look for a little house. There are five hundred
pounds in my stocking&mdash;did I tell you?&mdash;his money,
alas!&mdash;but I hope honestly earned.&#8221;</p>

<p>John took from his pocket a sheaf of notes written
in pencil. Much new material had come to him in
the course of the week-end at Doe Hill for the speech
he was meditating in the House of Commons. &#8220;But
don&#8217;t let us deceive ourselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are
not in the least likely to listen to a private member.
Strong as this indictment is it will impress neither the
Cabinet nor the rank and file. They are men of straw.
The U. P. put them where they are and it can remove
them to-morrow. At least, they believe it can. Shade
of Gladstone and Bright! Shade of Burke and Pitt!
that a newspaper trust should have them all in its
pocket.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>As he got up from the table, his face, which still
bore the marks of recent ill-usage, looked strained and
curiously old. But any hint of weakness was effaced
by the eyes which burnt with lustre and intensity.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">JOHN ENDOR went down to the House of Commons
and made the speech of his life. Soon after
five, when he rose to benches more than half empty,
to demand a remedy against that ever-growing evil, the
menace of the Newspaper Trust, many honorable members
smiled. In a few brief years, the disintegration
of the Mother of Parliaments was all but complete.
This crowd of time-servers and adventurers, composed
in the main of bagmen and trade-union officials were
under no illusion as to the terms of their tenure. These
hungry ravens knew better than to peck the gentle
hand that fed them.</p>

<p>How often, besides, had they heard all this &#8220;gup.&#8221;
There was nothing new in it. And this man Endor
was either an egotistical donkey or a purblind idiot
not to be aware that he was merely butting his head
against a stone wall. At the next general election,
which might come at any time now, it would simply be
a case of &#8220;Endor must go.&#8221; And Endor would go.
The Endors always did.</p>

<p>Didn&#8217;t this triple-play ass know that every word he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
uttered was digging his own grave? Such passion,
such irony, such precision, such cumulative force simply
asked for the scrap heap. Dating from the middle of
the late war, that thrice blessed upheaval! the scrap
heap was where all the Endors had gone. Education,
breeding, dedication, were back numbers at Westminster.
The country&#8217;s, the Empire&#8217;s, government,
thank God! was now in the hands of business
men. &#8220;We believe in the U. P. and we are registered
subscribers!&#8221; That was the open sesame, just that
simple and modest oath of allegiance. It was as easy
as swallowing butter.</p>

<p>Some of the honorable members dozed a little in the
course of this crack-brained fellow&#8217;s oratory, others
retired to the refreshment room to get a cup of tea.
And the few who listened to the strange words, so
much out of place within those walls, two or perhaps
three of the old hands, hardened &aelig;sthetes, not yet quite
dead of fatty degeneration of the soul, could not restrain
their minds from reverting to the days before
the deluge. Bright! Gladstone! Asquith! Grey!
Be it so. In the end, every country had the government
it really wanted.</p>

<p>Just one there was, among those who deigned to
hear John Endor who went even a step farther than
these disloyal camp-followers of the U. P. On each
side of this magnate on the Treasury Bench was an
overdressed but underbred colleague&mdash;an ordinance
sometimes resorted to by Divine Providence to restore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
the <i>aurea mediocritas</i>&mdash;for the magnate himself
happened to be the prime minister.</p>

<p>There is no need, at any rate, in these pages, to
decorate him with the pomp of capital letters. The
prime minister of Britain was a supine and ignoble
figure in the view of many. Wilberforce Williams by
name, he was generally known as &#8220;Slippery Sam,&#8221; because,
as his fervent admirers claimed, &#8220;you never
knew when you &#8217;ad him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody knew exactly how, when or why Slippery
Sam had made his way to his present eminence. Nobody
cared. But there he was on the front bench with
his boots cocked up on the table in front of him, master
of all he surveyed, with a whole set of blank coupons,
two books full, in his pocket. There he was and
if possible there he meant to stay.</p>

<p>On principle the prime minister listened to John
Endor. It may seem a little odd that such a man as
Mr. Williams should have had a principle to indulge;
certainly it was not at the call of mere duty or at the
beck of truth that he now listened to this young man
who took himself and his country so seriously. But
Mr. Williams was a little intrigued by him, in the way
he was a little intrigued by so many things. For, like
other prime ministers before him, he was by way of
being an amateur of the human comedy. Therefore,
he knew the authentic note when he heard it.</p>

<p>Nobody, not even the Colossus himself, had penetrated
to the fact that, in point of sheer cleverness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
Slippery Sam was at that moment without a peer in
the realm. Cleverness may not be a specially high
attribute, and Mr. Williams, who was perfectly frank
with himself, would have been the first to say so, but
occasions do arise when it has its uses.</p>

<p>One of these now occurred. Midway through the
speech of this rather simple but very gifted young man,
there came the word China.</p>

<p>The prime minister, it seemed, had lately been paying
a good deal of attention to China. His thoughts were
in this wise. &#8220;In my pocketbook is the ukase that infernal
fellow H. had the effrontery to hurl at me the
other day in his own handwriting.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p class="right">&#8220;Saint James&#8217;s Square,<br />
&#8220;Friday afternoon</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dear W. W.</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;Send the Fleet to Peking before Japan gets in, or
forfeit all claim to thinking Imperially.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours, in haste,</span><br />

&#8220;S. H.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Williams&#8217; mind as it now reverted to China was
a complex of many things. Listening to that name
of ill omen on the lips of the member for Blackhampton,
listening to the burning scorn of his words, the
prime minister suddenly remembered the giants of his
youth. Above all, he remembered Gladstone&#8217;s power
of carrying not only the House, but the country with
him on a live issue.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>This young man Endor, out of date as he was, a
rather tragic anachronism in that <i>c&eacute;nacle</i> sprawling,
dozing and sneering around him, was a voice from the
past. He had not the ear of the House it was true.
The simple fact was, the House no longer possessed
an ear; it had no longer the power to react to style or
tradition. Demosthenes himself could not have pierced
these professional hardbakes, who ran the country on
the lines of their trade-unions. The British House of
Commons was now the most soulless and vulgar of all
assemblies; the U. P. had castrated it; but the prime
minister, at any rate, was still able to recognize the
divine fire.</p>

<p>Moreover, the flame burning in the heart of this
young man, John Endor, set him thinking.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE thoughts of Slippery Sam were after this
fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;H. means war with China. And he has already
said in my private ear, &#8216;If you don&#8217;t do my bidding I
shall have you out and put in somebody who will.&#8217;
Now I, Wilberforce Williams, who am quite frank
with myself, though with nobody else, do not want
war with China. It will be an unjust war. It will
be an ill-timed war, because money is still pretty &#8216;tight,&#8217;
and war itself is still out of fashion. Moreover, it
may lead ultimately&mdash;[Mr. Williams was a far-sighted
man]&mdash;to trouble with Japan and possibly, I don&#8217;t say
probably, to war with the United States. Nor do I
think this Chinese business can ever be popular. Hartz
says his newspapers and his cinemas shall make it
popular. Well, it is only too true, that in that line
he can do anything ... all the same ... this may
be ... I don&#8217;t say it is ... the psychological moment
for the much trodden worm to begin to turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;China might make a live issue to take to the country
in the good old-fashioned way. A general election<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
must come within three months. I&#8217;ve had the nous,
thank God, to keep the old party machine in being.
It needs overhauling and bringing up-to-date, but there
is a certain amount of money in the party chest, and
if I can get the right people in charge&mdash;alas, honest
men are very shy of me!&mdash;it is just possible&mdash;don&#8217;t let
us put it higher&mdash;that W. W. may catch the Colossus
napping.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much beguiled was this venerable-looking, white-haired
and ineffably cunning gentleman with the idea
that was slowly coming to birth in his mind. No
sooner had the member for Blackhampton sat down,
which he did amid murmurs of ironical applause, after
boring the House of Commons for a full hour, although
posterity may be inclined to take a more lenient view
of the performance, than the prime minister retired
to his room. In that seclusion, he amused himself
with a little quiet study of Whitaker. This young
man, at the Stunt Election of 19&mdash;, although not taking
quite so kindly to the Coupon as he might have done,
had yet been returned for Blackhampton by a solid majority
of four thousand odd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; ruminated the prime minister, &#8220;Blackhampton
is the metropolis of the midland counties and in
those parts they are a shrewd, hard-headed folk. They
have a knack of going pretty straight to the root of
most matters. And they appear to have a good opinion
of John Endor. It might do no harm to have a little
preliminary try-out at Blackhampton, to learn the thickness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
of the ice and to gauge the temperature of the
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>So grateful was the idea to the mind of Mr. Williams
that as he went into the lobby in search of John Endor
he smiled pleasantly at his thoughts. By a happy
chance, almost the first man he met was the member
for Blackhampton.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Endor,&#8221;&mdash;in the humane art of patting
on the shoulder the younger generation Slippery
Sam had no peer&mdash;&#8220;permit me, if I may&mdash;without impertinence&mdash;to
congratulate you&mdash;to congratulate you
most sincerely on a fine&mdash;a really fine&mdash;effort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said the member for Blackhampton.
&#8220;It is very good of you.&#8221; Na&iuml;f young man, he
could not withhold a little blush of pleasure! There
was such a genuine ring in this voice of fatherly benevolence.
Besides, to John Endor, anachronism as he
was, the prime minister of England still meant something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let me be fulsome&#8221;&mdash;the well modulated voice
of Mr. Williams could achieve real charm on these
occasions&mdash;&#8220;but do you know whom you brought back
to the mind of an old man? Mr. Gladstone. As I
sat listening to you, my dear sir, I thought of the long
ago&mdash;alas, how long ago it seemed!&mdash;when Mr. Gladstone
brought in his Bill for Ireland. But, as I say,
don&#8217;t let me be fulsome.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Endor was dumb before these praises.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your grandfather the Duke,&#8221; the prime minister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
flowed smoothly on, &#8220;was a little before my day. But
he was a great man. His speeches in Another Place
on the People&#8217;s Charter live in history. For a man
of his time and class he was most enlightened. I am
so glad for his sake that there is still among us one
of his kin to bear the torch.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Endor was still dumb, but now he glowed with
happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder, Mr. Endor, if you can dine with us to-morrow
at Number 10, just my wife and me? Nobody
else, except perhaps, my daughter. But quite informal&mdash;just
<i>en famille</i>. Afterwards over a cigar, we&#8217;ll have
a little talk. Your fine speech ... it&#8217;s ... well, to-morrow
evening, at eight.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT eight o&#8217;clock the next evening, John Endor
found himself in the prime minister&#8217;s drawing room,
shaking hands with the prime minister&#8217;s lady.</p>

<p>The celebrated &#8220;Mrs. Wilber&#8221; was a tall, rather
austere dame, with the remains of considerable good
looks; moreover, they conferred upon her an air of
intellectual distinction to which she was hardly entitled.
Mrs. Wilber, it is true, had an almost sublime power
of putting her foot in it; but this faculty in a prime
minister&#8217;s lady may spring from one of two causes:
she may have too many brains, or she may have too
few. Slippery Sam&#8217;s greatest enemies had never accused
his wife of having too many.</p>

<p>By no means brilliant herself, Mrs. Wilber profoundly
distrusted scintillation in others. Her husband
she regarded as good rather than brilliant; indeed,
in her attitude to her lord, she was almost a latter-day
equivalent of Mrs. Gladstone. She seemed to
regard the prime minister as too bright and good for
human nature&#8217;s daily food; in fact, a kind of composite
of the librarian to the House of Lords and a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
highly distinguished personage in Heaven. To those
best acquainted with the singularly complex character
of the first minister of the Crown, this obsession of
Mrs. Wilber&#8217;s was a source of pure joy.</p>

<p>John Endor was too elemental to give overmuch
thought to the Mrs. Wilbers of life. All the same,
he had humor enough to appreciate his hostess&#8217; sovereign
faculty of &#8220;putting her foot in it.&#8221; Dinner had
hardly begun when she was openly rebuked by a clever,
charming, unconventional young daughter seated opposite
Mr. Endor, for announcing &#8220;that it gave her
so much pleasure to find that gentlemen were still to
be found in politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, mother!&#8221; Miss Clarice reproved her with
the very latest Oxford inflection.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilber shifted her ground a little, although
maintaining the general position by asking after &#8220;dear
Lady Elizabeth.&#8221; She herself claimed to be of solid
Middleshire county stock; indeed, one of her father&#8217;s
properties marched with Wyndham, and she was able
to remember John&#8217;s own father being acclaimed as one
of the best men to hounds of his generation.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I hear you are going to be married, Mr. Endor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rather a blow this, to Miss Clarice, who brought
her charming nose to the menu card before attacking
a curry.</p>

<p>She bore up very well, in spite of the fact that she
had already told herself privately that she would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
to consider the question of marrying Mr. John Endor.</p>

<p>He was good to look at certainly, his low voice a
delight, there was not a hint of stiffness or formality
about him, and, crowning joy, he had a sense of humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;How exciting!&#8221; Only a very little curry was
needed for Miss Clarice to effect a superb, if rather
stoical, recovery. &#8220;Do tell me. Who is the lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Helen Sholto of Virginia, my dear.&#8221; Mrs.
Wilber had seen the announcement in the <i>Morning
Post</i>, and had known how to cherish it in a manner
becoming a prime minister&#8217;s lady. &#8220;But tell me, Mr.
Endor, what does dear Lady Elizabeth say?&#8221; In she
went again, horse, foot, and artillery. &#8220;Virginia is in
the south, I believe, which is not the <i>moneyed</i> part of
America. But all Americans, of course, have money.&#8221;</p>

<p>A look of blank despair settled upon Miss Clarice,
who was inclined to see her mother, not in terms of
Mrs. Gladstone, but in terms of Mrs. Dizzy.</p>

<p>John Endor enjoyed his dinner all the same and so
did Miss Clarice. The talk was really quite amusing.
Mr. Williams himself was a model host and no mean
conversationalist. He went back a long way. Even
in Victorian times he had been in the inner circle of
society and politics. He had a fund of anecdote which
no man living knew better how to employ. He was
always geniality itself, and on occasions of modest festivity
in the bosom of his family he was wholly
delightful.</p>

<p>It was in the library, however, after dinner that John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
Endor really found himself at grips with Fate. Ushered
into an armchair, strategically disposed so that the bust
of Pitt should be on his right and a set of the Encyclopedia
Britannica on his left, two adjuncts indispensable
to the library of Number 10 Downing Street, and duly
furnished with an excellent cigar, the neophyte settled
himself to hear golden words.</p>

<p>In the delicate and judicious phrase of the prime
minister, it seemed that one Bendish, an admirable
man, was living now under the threat of Bright&#8217;s
disease, and that in the opinion of Mrs. Bendish, an
admirable woman, only one place could hope to arrest
the ravages of such a grave malady. That place was
the House of Lords. Whether the air of the Gilded
Chamber was more salubrious, whether its system of
drainage was more modern, the central heating more
efficient, the ventilation less inadequate, was one of
those problems which the prime minister, having no
first-hand knowledge of Another Place, did not offer
to solve. But there the matter was. Mrs. Bendish, an
admirable woman, was convinced that, for Bright&#8217;s
disease, the rarified atmosphere of the House of Lords
was the only remedy. Alas, that Mr. Bendish should
be smitten with so fell a malady!</p>

<p>The prime minister, however, was by no means
averse from applying the antidote. Drastic, no doubt,
but Mrs. Bendish, a Spartan wife, was adamant. Unhappily,
Mr. Bendish would not be able to continue his
signal work for the State. The Home Office and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
House of Lords are not necessarily incompatible, but
like Burgundy and port they are a combination not
quite suited to all constitutions. Such at least, in
this case, was the view of the prime minister. In the
event of Mr. Bendish really going to the House of
Lords&mdash;and Mrs. Bendish was so firm on the point
that it hardly admitted of doubt&mdash;it would be expedient
for his Britannic majesty to seek a new secretary
of state for the Home Department. In a word, would
Mr. Endor take that Office?</p>

<p>Mr. Endor was a little staggered. The bust of Pitt
was on his right hand, a set of the Encyclopedia Britannica
was on his left, none the less, the prime minister&#8217;s
point-blank offer was in the nature of a bolt from
a blue sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will mean, I&#8217;m afraid, a by-election.&#8221; The
honeyed voice of Mr. Wilberforce Williams had the
mellifluity that endeared him to every journalist in
the land. &#8220;And&mdash;don&#8217;t let us deceive ourselves&mdash;my
dear sir&mdash;a stiff one. To be frank&mdash;to be perfectly
frank&mdash;the member for Blackhampton will not be exactly
<i>persona gratissima</i> in Universe Building.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the young Lothair, that was the amazing part of
the whole matter. He had no claim to subtlety of
mind, but he was not a fool. What was in the wind?
Well he knew that for the member for Blackhampton
to be given the Home Office was tantamount to Slippery
Sam throwing down the gage of battle to the
U. P.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>&#8220;Take a little time for your answer, my dear sir.&#8221;
Such linked sweetness must have seemed a little excessive
in any one not the prime minister. &#8220;Take
twenty-four&mdash;forty-eight&mdash;yes, forty-eight hours&mdash;shall
we say? In the meantime, may I rely&mdash;of course
I may&mdash;such a superfluous question&mdash;on your absolute
discretion?&#8221;</p>

<p>John Endor gave that unnecessary assurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, my dear sir, do you not?&#8221;&mdash;the smile of
Slippery Sam was deliciously vulpine. &#8220;As soon as
they get wind of this in Universe Building, the Great
General Staff will be in the field with a hundred fully
mobilized army corps&mdash;before even our dear Mr. Bendish
can apply for the Chiltern Hundreds.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FORTY-EIGHT hours were indeed necessary for
John Endor to make up his mind. A big decision
confronted him. Even if he were given the Home
Office on his own terms, and he had promptly decided
that he would take it on no other, it was certain that,
with the full weight of the U. P. against him, he would
have a terrific fight to hold his seat. Moreover, if he
managed to retain it, and faced with &#8220;the machine,&#8221;
the chances were that he would not, within a few
months a general election was due, and he would have
to fight again.</p>

<p>Brief study of the tactical position, combined with
a little analysis of Slippery Sam&#8217;s fair-seeming offer
soon brought him perilously near the truth. A by-election
in such a constituency as East Blackhampton
would be a <i>ballon d&#8217;essai</i>, a try-out, a testing of the
ice. The astute personage who dangled this lure of
office would risk little. If a tyro, a comparative free
lance, new to high places, failed to win East Blackhampton,
he would be dropped like a hot coal. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
rebuff would be accepted gracefully and an orthodox
coupon-swallower, a &#8220;safe&#8221; man put up in his stead.
Things would go on as they were; and the noble company
of time-servers would trim their sails for the
coming dissolution in the old happy way. But as
Endor clearly saw, failure for him in such circumstances
was likely to mean the end of his political career.</p>

<p>Was he justified in taking such a tremendous risk?
He put the case squarely to Helen; it was but fair
and right that he should do so. And she, at least, did
not hesitate. Her faith in him was complete. Let
him follow his star. The chance of his life had come.
Let him show himself worthy of it.</p>

<p>His own instincts were knightly, but he could not
rid his mind of a secret fear of Slippery Sam. How
far would it be possible for John Endor to serve under
the official banner of the most accomplished trimmer
in the land? Finally, before deciding the matter one
way or the other, he determined to see what terms he
could make with this illustrious chieftain.</p>

<p>In effect his answer, when duly delivered to the
prime minister was that he would accept the Office and
run the gauntlet if, in the event of success, Mr. Williams
would himself frame a bill to deal with the Newspaper
Trust. Such a measure must be the first plank
in the Government platform when he appealed to the
country six months hence.</p>

<p>Somewhat to Mr. Endor&#8217;s surprise, the prime minister
agreed to this course. Great parliamentarian as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Slippery Sam undoubtedly was, with an insight almost
uncanny into the workings of the minds of his chosen
instruments, he had anticipated the need for some such
compact, before making the offer. Indeed, John Endor&#8217;s
demand came to him as a subtle reminder of his
own prescience.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams was the last man in the world to take
a leap in the dark. His plans were laid pretty deep.
This picturesque young visionary, with his ancient
name, his family tradition, his virile enthusiasm, was
the one man in that House or out of it to sweep the
whole country if the cause that nerved him were great
enough.</p>

<p>In the considered opinion of Mr. Williams the cry
<i>Break the Newspaper Trust and Bring Down the
Price of Everything</i> was the only possible counter to
the massed and entrenched forces of the enemy. At
least it would rally the cruelly overburdened upper and
middle classes; and conceivably it might woo sufficient
of the &#8220;workers&#8221; from the spells of the U. P. to rout
the Colossus with all his stunts and all his wiles.</p>

<p>At all events, Mr. Williams had now reached the
conclusion that the yoke of Saul Hartz was intolerable.
The question of China was the final straw that had
broken the back of the camel. In his own good time
he would try a fall with the U. P. Sooner or later
it would have to be. His chains had grown unbearable.
If he failed, rather than endure the ignominy
of serving such a tyrant, he would retire from politics.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
If he succeeded, politics once again might offer a career
for reasonably honest men.</p>

<p>In any event, nothing could have shown a more
statesmanlike grasp of the amazingly complex conditions
of the time than his choice of John Endor as the
prophet of the new gospel&mdash;<i>Down with the U. P.</i></p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE plunging into the fray at Blackhampton,
Endor did a bold thing. He got married. A fortnight&#8217;s
grace was allowed him by the Government, before
the issuing of the writs; and more than one consideration
urged him to turn that precious interregnum
to high account.</p>

<p>Wyndham itself was hardly more than ten miles
from Blackhampton and this he made his headquarters
for the fight. Having due regard to the circumstances
of the case, John felt it would be wise to get through
the business of being married with the least possible
delay. Moreover, an impetuous nature urged him to
this course. The opposition of his mother, conceal it
as she might, he knew to be strong. It would be kinder
to her, therefore, to rush the matrimonial fence. And
he hoped that the old lady&#8217;s mind would be distracted
by the shock of events from dwelling too much on the
affront to her wishes, the death of her hopes.</p>

<p>Again there was policy in this dispatch. Helen was
going to be a great ally in the fight. An accomplished
speaker, she thoroughly understood her own sex, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
on the platform and in the press she had a way with
her in her dealings with them. As the blushing bride
of John Endor, an old and tried friend, now with his
back to the wall, fighting for his political life, she
would be in a position to steal a little of the enemy&#8217;s
thunder. &#8220;Aunt Mittie,&#8221; &#8220;Lovely Lily Langrish,&#8221; and
their like, who had proved so formidable at other Stunt
elections up and down the land, must look to their laurels.
Romance of a more genuine kind might invest
John Endor and his new and singularly attractive
American wife. And if only &#8220;they could get the real
goods over&#8221; with half the skill of the U. P. the fire
of several big enemy batteries was likely to be dominated.</p>

<p>The wedding at the tiny church of the ancestral village
was the simplest and quietest affair. No more
than a handful of indispensables were there; just a few
friends and relations who were bound to be present.
George Hierons gave Helen away. This remarkable
man was becoming very much the friend of both.
He heartily approved Helen&#8217;s severance from the <i>Planet</i>
and Saul Hartz; moreover, he ventured upon the prophecy
that Endor with such a wife would go far.</p>

<p>Lady Elizabeth, of course, was scandalized by the
whole affair. Such a &#8220;nose-dive&#8221; into the holy state,
such an absence of all trumpets and shawms, was
worthy indeed of &#8220;Comrade&#8221; Endor. This undignified
haste was nothing short of indecent; Lady Elizabeth
had fully counted on &#8220;an engagement of at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
two years.&#8221; She felt, in fact, that she had every
right to insist upon it. Still the old Die-hard supposed
she must look at the bright side of the picture:
this Miss Sholto, although an American, was not a person
of color. She had no money, therefore John&#8217;s
infatuation for her was extremely reprehensible; at the
same time, she seemed a shrewd, sensible, practical
girl, and had the makings no doubt of an excellent
wife. But if she was only a quarter as extravagant
as the other American wives Lady Elizabeth had heard
of, it would be quite impossible for them to keep up
Wyndham. In the meantime, the old lady was a little
appeased by John&#8217;s announcement that they proposed
to live in London in a very modest fashion, strictly
in accordance with their own present income, and she
would be left to carry on at Wyndham in the way she
had always done.</p>

<p>The Blackhampton by-election might be an odd kind
of honeymoon, yet John and Helen considered it to be
an affair vastly more exhilarating than the regulation
visit to an empty country house which ended invariably
in boredom. At any rate, to John and Helen, there
was nothing in the least boring about the Blackhampton
election.</p>

<p>To begin with, they recognized from the outset how
much was at stake. Then, too, Blackhampton itself,
a live place, with three hundred thousand particularly
live people in it, was by no means addicted to boredom.
For these the world was far too full of a number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
things interesting for that form of poison to be allowed
to enter.</p>

<p>The member for <i>Blackhampton East</i> was to find
moreover, when in person he came to open the campaign,
that he had not entered the lists a moment too
soon. The enemy was in the field already. It was
never the way of the U. P.&mdash;for the sake of clearness
and brevity, the foe may be incorporated in that comprehensive
title&mdash;to let the grass grow beneath its feet.
As Mr. Wilberforce Williams had himself predicted,
within twenty-four hours of the Government showing
its hand, the Great General Staff of Cosmos Alley and
Universe Lane was ready to the last gaiter button.</p>

<p>East Blackhampton itself had for some little time
past been on a war basis. Several months ago had
come the order &#8220;from above&#8221; that at the next election
ENDOR MUST GO. Everything was in review order
for &#8220;the day.&#8221; So declared the U. P. agent-in-chief,
at any rate. For many moons the constituency
had been sedulously nursed by one of the regulation
Colonial &#8220;bagmen,&#8221; Sir Stuyvescent Milgrim K. B. E.
by name, a distinguished member of a famous army
which had won the war without going near it.</p>

<p>When Mr. Endor at last came on to the scene, a little
belatedly as it seemed to his own election agent, Mr.
Ambrose Furley, he was received by that gentleman at
the Central Committee Rooms. These were situated
in Market Square, almost under the shadow of the noble
statue of John Bright, by G. F. Watts.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Home Secretary-elect found his chief supporters
heavily cast down.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got a long start of us, already, Mr. Endor,
and let me tell you, sir, they are out for blood.&#8221;
Such was the greeting of Mr. Ambrose Furley, a tall,
thin gentleman, not by nature an optimist, who wore,
as became the fine flower of Blackhampton&#8217;s intelligentsia
the black cord of his gold-rimmed eyeglasses
round a red left ear. &#8220;And if I may be so bold as to
offer an opinion, there&#8217;s only one thing can save us
from getting it fairly in the neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>The member for East Blackhampton was not unused
to the somber half-tones of his agent&#8217;s mind, but he
did not look for such out-and-out pessimism, even in
Mr. Ambrose Furley.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, sir,&#8221; continued Mr. Furley, &#8220;from what I
hear, the U. P. has made up its mind to do you in, no
matter what it costs them.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Endor, unshaken, smiled the smile of the happy
warrior.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>The pessimism of Mr. Ambrose Furley grew a shade
less defiant. &#8220;However, you may have a dog&#8217;s chance,
Mr. Endor, and that&#8217;s about all. But take it from me,
sir, even that chance depends, as you might say, on
one contingency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you think we may still venture to hope?&#8221; There
was a light in the eye of John Endor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t put it as high as a hope, sir.&#8221; In his use
of the English language Mr. Furley liked to be precise.
&#8220;A shadow of a hope is more like it. And as
I have already said even that depends upon one contingency.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the urbanity that all the Member&#8217;s supporters
so greatly admired, Mr. Endor waited patiently while
Mr. Ambrose Furley in his own good time proceeded
to show what &#8220;the contingency&#8221; was. &#8220;It&#8217;s like this,
do you see, sir? We mustn&#8217;t be blind to the fact that
we are up against a ticklish situation. The voting in
this election is going to be very cross. Now that you&#8217;ve
come out so strong, much too strong most of us think
here, against the U. P. there&#8217;s bound to be a big turnover
of votes, unless we can get one man to come down
on the right side of the fence. It&#8217;s just on the cards,
if the gentleman in question does that, that we may
not be beaten to a frazzle. But I don&#8217;t say he will.
At the moment he&#8217;s seated on it. By nature he&#8217;s a
blue, a regular blue&mdash;but there&#8217;s just a chance that,
by a bit of management, he may come over to us. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
if he does&mdash;well, sir, as I say, the voting at this election
will be very cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point the Member ventured tactfully to ask
the name of the unknown power.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Josiah Munt,&#8221; said Mr. Furley, impressively.
&#8220;Blackhampton&#8217;s Big Noise. In fact, sir,&#8221; Mr. Furley
became almost lyrical, &#8220;Blackhampton&#8217;s Grand Old
Man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think there&#8217;s a chance of Sir Josiah coming
over?&#8221; The Member, for all his air of detachment,
knew far more about local politics than appeared on
the surface. &#8220;By Jove, that would be one up to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet it would, Mr. Endor. Sir Josiah is not
everybody&#8217;s pretty boy, but he carries weight in this
city. He&#8217;s a very honest man and he&#8217;s dead against
&#8216;graft.&#8217; It seems to me, sir, strictly between ourselves&#8221;&mdash;Mr.
Ambrose Furley had all the shrewd penetration
of a true Blackhamptonian&mdash;&#8220;that the U. P. is playing
things up so high that there&#8217;s a poss-i-bil-ity, so far as
Sir Munt is concerned, that it may overreach itself
if it doesn&#8217;t watch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good news if it is so. Can you suggest a means,
Mr. Furley, of taking advantage of the fact?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well sir, let us get down to brass tacks. Sir Munt
is a bit of a One. He can&#8217;t be hustled. He can&#8217;t
be driven. But he can see as far through a brick wall
as most people. And last evening, as he was leaving
the Floral Hall after the Sacred Harmonic Society&#8217;s
annual performance of the Golden Legend in the company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
of Alderman Kearsley, another old-fashioned
blue, he was overheard to remark, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry to say it,
Kearsley, but I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s going to be awful graft
at this election.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Member agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming from a gentleman in Sir Munt&#8217;s position
those words mean a great deal. He knows very well
that the graft is on his own side. The U. P. is so slick
nowadays that it is beginning to give the Old Man cold
feet. There&#8217;s such a thing as being too clever in this
world, Mr. Endor, and strictly between you and me,
sir, the over cleverness of the other side is the only
chance we&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Ambrose Furley paused dramatically
to readjust the cord of his eyeglasses round his
left ear. It was an infallible sign on his part of constructive
thought. &#8220;Do you know, sir,&#8221; he said after
a long moment of silence, &#8220;what I should do if I were
you? It may be a little <i>infra dignitatem</i>, but I should
take the earliest opportunity of stepping across the
Market Place to the Mayor&#8217;s Parlor and having a little
heart-to-heart talk with Sir Munt. It may be <i>infra
dignitatem</i>, as I say, but if you put the case against
the U. P. only half as well as you put it in Parliament
the other day, you&#8217;ll lose nothing by it. Sir Munt is a
patriot, an imperialist, a protectionist, and all that, but
when it comes to a showdown he&#8217;s a man who knows
how many beans make five.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Agent&#8217;s argument found prompt favor in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
sight of John Endor. It came to him, in fact, rather
in the light of an inspiration. A shrewd race these
Blackhamptonians! There and then he decided to have
an interview with the famous and admired Sir Josiah
Munt.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;SIR MUNT,&#8221; for the nth time Mayor of Blackhampton,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
was in his parlor at the City Hall,
gazing into the heavens. A contraption rather like a
monstrous aluminum fish shining in the October air
hung above Market Square. At regular intervals of
a minute or so there came fluttering down from the
huge object in the sky a rain of leaflets. These varied
in color and they fell upon the heads of the citizens.</p>

<p>At last, yet not without effort of will, Sir Munt set
a term to his entrancement. He went across to his
writing table and pressed the bell once. A small imp
in a very tight suit of buttons promptly answered the
summons.</p>

<p>&#8220;Niblo,&#8221; said the Chief Magistrate, &#8220;step into the
square and collect some of that d&eacute;-bris. Bring one
of each color, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Preternaturally sharp in all circumstances, Niblo
fully understood what was required. He made his exit
with a duck.</p>

<p>Sir Munt turned thoughtfully to the room&#8217;s second
occupant. Its second occupant was no less a personage
than his stenographer, Miss Evans. An intelligent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
demure, stylishly attractive young lady, she was seated
before a typewriter carefully transcribing from her
private notes a sheaf of letters recently dictated to her
by the Mayor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Evans,&#8221; said his worship, &#8220;if you&#8217;ve written
that letter to Sir Stuyvescent Milgrim let me see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The letter duly detached from the growing pile was
handed to the Mayor, who looked every inch of him&mdash;and
they were many&mdash;the City&#8217;s Chief Magistrate, as
he put on a pair of eyeglasses to peruse it. For several
minutes he studied the letter in silence with the frown
of a man who did not quite know his own mind. At
last, the study was terminated and the frown increased
by the return of Niblo, who with a fine air of importance
bore a number of pamphlets, some of which were
white, some of which were red, some of which were
blue.</p>

<p>Sir Munt read the white one first:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>Sir Munt&#8217;s only comment on these exhibits was a
slight pursing of the lips. But his countenance, at all
times a little heavy, grew decidedly dour. Moreover,
he ruminated exceedingly.</p>

<p>He was still deeply involved in the process of
thought, when he was interrupted by a fierce and sudden
ring of the telephone bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! Yes!&#8221; said Miss Evans, receiver in hand. A
moment later the Mayor was informed that Mr. Endor,
M. P., sent his compliments, and could Sir Josiah make
it convenient to see him at once if he came over from
his committee rooms at the other side of the Square.</p>

<p>Sir Josiah pondered the matter for a long and serious
moment. And then he said weightily: &#8220;Tell Mr.
Endor I&#8217;ll see him now if he cares to nip across.&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">JOHN ENDOR&#8217;S talk with Sir Munt gave that
gentleman much food for thought. For twenty-five
years the Mayor of Blackhampton had voted Blue.
In the purview of Yellow, its arch and traditional foe,
Blue was the badge of Reaction, of Capitalism, of
Imperialism, of Mass-oppression. Yellow, in the opinion
of Blue, was the badge of Ca&#8217; Canny, Democratic
Insolence, Class Prejudice, Mob Rule. Once upon a
time, no doubt, the two colors may have approximated
more or less to these extremes.</p>

<p>Since the Great War, however, and the rise to power
of the Newspaper Ring, things had changed. In fact
they were always changing. At the beck of Cosmos
Alley and Universe Lane, these two primary colors
were now interchangeable terms. Blue became Yellow,
and Yellow became Blue in deference to the will of the
magician who presided over the destinies of the U. P.
In fact the art of government by newspaper had been
raised to such a pitch that it took a very shrewd head
to know who and what it was voting for. Sir Munt
had a head of that kind, but more than once of late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
years in matters political its owner had been completely
at fault.</p>

<p>At the last General Election, some six years ago,
the U. P.&mdash;profanely called the Stunt Press&mdash;had declared
for John Endor, then a tyro and greenhorn new
to political life under modern conditions. He had
been returned to parliament in consequence by a big
majority. This time, however, the boot was on the
other leg. &#8220;Endor must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The member for Blackhampton East had much to say
to Sir Munt, and he said it cogently. The two men
were singularly unlike. Endor, a highly civilized man
of liberal ideas, was consumed with a desire to leave
the world a little better than he found it. Sir Josiah, on
the other hand, had not been born to social advantages.
Entirely self-educated he had made his way by mother
wit and force of will; but like so many of his kind, to
whom life had brought prosperity, he too, had a regard
for the body politic. In Sir Munt the vein of idealism
which ennobled John Endor was conspicuously lacking.
He had seen too much of the ugly side of life to
have any great hopes of human nature. All the same
he was a good citizen and a very honest man. Rough
he might be, on the surface, but his hand was often in
his pocket; and he grudged neither time nor trouble in
grappling with the eternal problem of the Under Dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;You tell me, Mr. Endor,&#8221; said Sir Munt, looking
at his visitor in what he would have himself described
as &#8220;an old-fashioned way,&#8221; &#8220;you tell me, sir, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
Stunt Press has behind it a ring of capitalists, with one
man at its head, who is determined to become the dictator
of this country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said John Endor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; said Blackhampton&#8217;s Chief Magistrate,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that to be possible. One man&mdash;I don&#8217;t
care how clever&mdash;can&#8217;t run a country like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saul Hartz steadily keeps that end in view. And
his Trust is now organized in such a wonderful way
that in the near future anything may happen. You see
the Machine, as one may call it, of which this man
Hartz is the linchpin has now a finger in every pie. A
child can hardly buy a packet of pins without its permission.
Its great opportunity came with the famine
in paper and the world shortage in raw materials, which
Saul Hartz was able to foresee. No one questions his
power of looking ahead although he has paid a long
price for it to the Devil. It has enabled him to corner,
among other essential commodities, the inadequate supplies
of news print. And when some years ago the
crisis arose in the newspaper world, the entire British
press had to make its choice&mdash;each individual journal,
no matter what its traditions, must either enter the
Ring on Saul Hartz&#8217;s terms or close down. The best
of them preferred to close down. One or two carried
on and still do so with the help of private backers. But
they are no more than voices crying in the wilderness
and I am assured, by those who know, that in every
case they are heavy losers financially. To begin with,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
you see, running a newspaper is no longer a business
proposition for anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Josiah agreed. &#8220;For some time past I have been
given to understand that the cost of paper and printing
is prohibitive. Tatlow has to charge fourpence a day
for the Blackhampton <i>Monitor</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because the <i>Monitor</i> is outside the Ring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so. And it&#8217;s about a quarter as good as the
Blackhampton <i>Mercury</i> which charges three halfpence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The explanation is simple. One has pages upon
pages of advertising matter; the other has none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you have the key of the position. Advertisements
are the life blood of the Press. The Ring
says to every advertising agent in the country: &#8216;Advertise
in any paper in the British Empire outside those
controlled by us, and we refuse you all publicity.&#8217; Just
think what that means to any business community. And
you must please bear in mind that the U. P. has not
only corralled all the chief newspapers and the raw materials
that create them, but also a fleet of airships to
distribute its products. Moreover, the Transatlantic
telephone, which has hardly been completed a year is
now in the hands of Saul Hartz.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Munt sat up in his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;By gum!&#8221; he said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Painfully true, I&#8217;m afraid. He has outwitted everybody
including our own Government and that of the
United States. During the last few months, events<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
have been tending very rapidly towards the enslavement
of the whole world. People don&#8217;t realize what this
inner ring of newspaper Bosses with Saul Hartz at
its head can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the Government about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Government is powerless. At least it chooses
to be. For one must never forget that it is composed
exclusively of nominees of the U. P.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Munt began to look worried. Ardent patriot
and shrewd man of affairs, above all he was a man
of business. The words of John Endor might sound
alarmist, but the Mayor of Blackhampton knew there
was a good deal behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Endor, if what you say&#8217;s correct, it&#8217;s high time
some of us were up and doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree; but it may be too late. Hartz is now
working night and day to get a &#8216;cinch&#8217; on America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t be easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easier perhaps than one may suppose. In the
mass the Americans are just as gullible as ourselves.
Hartz has been throwing dust in their eyes for years.
The U. P. propaganda is always working on them as
it is on us. Even now the average Briton is not alive
to the menace of the whole country being run by one
colossal trust. Give the American his due he has always
kept that contingency in mind. Years ago he
passed laws to prevent it. But the time is at hand
when our friends across the water will have to look out,
or Saul Hartz will be one too many for them. He has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
already got his foot well in. For some time now he has
had a working arrangement with the Breit Combine,
and if that mighty concern amalgamates with the
U. P., as I&#8217;m assured it will, nothing on the face of
this planet will be able to stand up against the power
of antichrist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Antichrist!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The shallow materialism of the western business
brain, of which the man Saul Hartz is the prophet, is
nothing less than that. Genius of a kind he has, no
doubt, but he lacks the essential faculty, like others
before him, of knowing when to stop. He sees World
Power in front of him, and under present conditions
he may be allowed to grasp it on terms easier than
would have been exacted of Napoleon I and Wilhelm
II.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Endor had many questions to answer in the
course of a long interview, but in the end he was able
to convince Sir Josiah Munt that the Newspaper Ring
was the writing on the wall not merely for Great Britain,
not merely for America, but for civilization itself.
The instance from his own experience the member for
Blackhampton East was able to adduce of the U. P.&#8217;s
power of manipulating news, and the worth of the
news when it had been manipulated, proved a clinching
argument for that honest citizen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be up and doing.&#8221; That was the thought
in the mind of Sir Munt as he shook hands with his
visitor and ushered him to the door. So powerfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
had the case against the Ring been urged by one whom
the Mayor instinctively respected, that he felt already
for once in his life the stern necessity of voting Yellow.
Native caution prevented his letting the candidate know
just what was in his mind; but as John Endor recrossed
the Market Square to his committee rooms he
was upheld by a feeling that he had gone some way
towards getting a strong man on his side.</p>

<p>Well it was to have this food for the spirit. The
fight, envenomed already by a felon stroke, was bound
to be severe. And the odds now massed against him
were so heavy that a nature less warlike might have
been overwhelmed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXVII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS the Mayor of Blackhampton watched from his
window at the City Hall the tall and striking
form of John Endor merge itself in the welter of citizens
below in Market Square, he knew that he was
faced by a momentous issue. The case against the
Government and the U. P., that unholy alliance which
had caused such widespread misery in the land and
which now was threatening once more the peace of the
world, had been urged with a force that had given the
good man a shock. A key was now his to many disconcerting
events of recent years, and he could but
marvel that long before this he had not had the wit to
discern the truth for himself. The shameful graft of
the new bureaucracy for which Government by Newspaper
had much to answer, he now saw from his own
experience, to be sapping the life and liberties of the
State.</p>

<p>More than once of late at the Imperial Club, whose
imposing freestone fa&ccedil;ade stared at him from the other
side of the Square, had Sir Munt during the luncheon
hour heard despondent businessmen declare &#8220;that what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
the country really wanted to put things right was
another war.&#8221; During the late upheaval, whose scars
had now begun to fade, all classes of the community
had shared in a delusive prosperity; but only the few
who controlled the means of production and their
nominees in Whitehall and Westminster had been permanently
enriched. The price of everything had been
forced up, yet the value of everything had gone down.</p>

<p>When Sir Munt entered the Club dining room at a
quarter past one as usual, he found it a hive. And it
was a hive seething with excitement. Political feeling
ran high. This by-election, having regard to all the
circumstances, promised to be quite one of the most
piquant of modern times. John Endor whom the U. P.
had returned by a solid majority of four thousand at
the last election, having bitten the hand that fostered
him, was now going ignominiously to be &#8220;fired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Serve him right!&#8221; The opinion of the Club dining
room was almost unanimous. But that which none of
these pundits could understand even now was why
in Wonder&#8217;s name had Slippery Sam offered John Endor
the Home Secretaryship? On the face of it such
a move was an open and palpable affront to the U. P.
In the light of that circumstance only one explanation
was feasible. The prime minister was riding for
a fall.</p>

<p>Even the most advanced thinkers at the Club luncheon
table hesitated to accept that view. Slippery Sam
was the wiliest of men; yet those who were ready to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
make every concession to his peculiar talent were quite
unable to read the riddle. If Endor was unseated, Mr.
Williams would have to appeal to the country. And
what would happen then?</p>

<p>No, the pundits declared themselves beaten. It was
left, however, to the shrewdest and weightiest of them
all to cast a ray of light upon the darkness. Sir Munt,
armed with the new and rather amazing knowledge
that had come to him less than an hour ago, proceeded
to electrify the table at the head of which he sat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comes to this, Murrell, my boy.&#8221; Poising an
oyster on an authoritative fork Sir Munt turned augustly
to Alderman Murrell, the eminent Imperialist
on his right. &#8220;Do we want another war or don&#8217;t we?
That&#8217;s what it comes to.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pause followed. And then, Sir Munt having enforced
the appeal to Alderman Murrell&#8217;s judgment by
demonstratively swallowing the oyster, the eminent Imperialist
gave a cock of the head and said: &#8220;Well, Sir
Munt, since you ask me I say &#8216;Yes&#8217; and I say &#8216;<i>No</i>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t ride both horses, my boy.&#8221; Sir Munt
poised oyster the second. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to make up
your mind to one on &#8217;em. If you want war you&#8217;ll vote
for this little Colonial Snot.&#8221;&mdash;Sensation!&mdash;&#8220;If you
don&#8217;t want war you&#8217;ll vote for John Endor.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pin might have been heard to fall on the Club mahogany.</p>

<p>&#8220;The time has come, Murrell, when some on us in
this City has got to do a bit o&#8217; clear thinkin&#8217;. But before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
we can do anything we must have the dust out
of our eyes. What is the Universal Press up to?&mdash;that&#8217;s
the first question to ask ourselves. For years
it has been preaching Disarmament in one column and
quoting Rudyard Kipling in the next. You may be
very bright and clever and quite well up in your business,
but oil and vitriol don&#8217;t always mix. Seems to
me, Murrell, it&#8217;s time we came to brass tacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alderman Murrell and his fellow Imperialists sat
up now and took notice. They had always been proud
to think that Sir Munt whose force of will and breadth
of view they deeply admired was one of themselves.
He was very much one of themselves in point of fact.
Was he not a trustee of the Club and permanent chairman
of its house committee? For him to break loose
in this unprecedented manner was indeed significant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been having a heart-to-heart talk with
Mr. Endor.&#8221; A swift exchange of glances between
the sconce-bearers of Sir Munt confirmed them in the
view that he undoubtedly had. &#8220;He says the long
and short o&#8217; the matter is, the U. P. is trying to force
the Government into a war with China.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sensation!</p>

<p>&#8220;The prime minister is against it, but the Cabinet
is in such fear of what the U. P. can do at the next
General Election that it means to force his hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can the U. P. do at the next General Election?&#8221;
inquired a mild voice on the left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most people think,&#8221; said Sir Munt, &#8220;that the U. P.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
can put out the present government as easily as it put
it in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should Saul Hartz want a war with
China?&#8221; persisted the mild voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Labor is getting out of hand. And he thinks it
may do good all round&mdash;buck up trade, keep up prices,
get the country and the colonies to pull together, and so
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be something in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so, Jennings,&#8221; said Sir Munt. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
got to look ahead. If we get monkeying with China,
the next thing on the tapis&mdash;so says Mr. Endor, and he
sees as far through a brick wall as most, does that
jockey&mdash;will be trouble between America and Japan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that going to matter?&#8221; inquired a second Imperialist.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to let Japan go under,&#8221; said Sir
Munt sternly. &#8220;Our commitments in that quarter are
too deep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand pities, it seems to me,&#8221; interposed the
slow dry voice of the manager of the National Bank,
&#8220;that America ever jacked up the League of Nations.
Seems to me that the world missed one of the opportunities
that can never recur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Thorp, I&#8217;m with you there.&#8221; Sir Munt sighed
heavily. &#8220;And she&#8217;s thought so, too, more than once,
I&#8217;ll bet a dollar. However, there it is. And here&#8217;s the
situation we&#8217;ve got to look at now. Every vote given
for the Colonial gentleman is a vote for the U. P.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
And to-day, says Mr. Endor, and I for one can believe
him, the U. P. means war with China. And to-morrow
it may mean war with somebody of more importance
than China.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Serve &#8217;em right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ill-timed remark from the other end of the table
was drowned in a chorus of stern dissent. Even to
these ardent minds such a contingency was not to be
thought of. But on one point the great man at the
table head was emphatic. Until the U. P. was brought
under control there could be no security for any nation,
any body of persons, any private individual. And the
moment being opportune, Sir Munt clinched his argument
with the story of the recent singular occurrence
in that city. Several of those who heard it, although
not among the admirers of John Endor&mdash;his views were
much too &#8220;woolly&#8221; for thoroughgoing Imperialists&mdash;had
been present at the famous luncheon. These now
bore reluctant witness to the fact that he had been misreported.
Not that it particularly mattered. Speechifying
didn&#8217;t cut much ice in these times. And it was
reasonable to allow every orator a certain amount of
latitude at a champagne luncheon.</p>

<p>&#8220;All very well,&#8221; growled Sir Munt. &#8220;But that speech
has gone round the world. His friends here, knowing
the man and knowing the circumstances in which the
speech was made, are content to believe that some one
has blundered. I don&#8217;t put it higher than that. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
at Hellington the next day he got a broken head instead
of a hearing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Honest Sir Munt, having made his point, subsided
now in a brief period of deglutition.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, in a favorite corner of the
smoking room, he had a little serious talk with Alderman
Murrell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like voting Yellow,&#8221; the Imperialist confided
in a rather perplexed voice. &#8220;Somehow it goes against
the grain, as it did against that of my father before me,
but if Mr. Endor can satisfy us that he is not in favor
of playing tricks with the Navy and the two-power
standard will be maintained, I&#8217;m not sure it isn&#8217;t my
duty on this occasion&#8221;&mdash;even in the sanctity of the
Club precincts the worthy alderman could not resist a
rhetorical flourish&mdash;&#8220;on this occasion to record my vote
for the Clean, the Decent, the Aboveboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Munt looked in quite &#8220;an old-fashioned way&#8221;
at his friend. &#8220;You must be careful, Murrell, my
boy,&#8221;&mdash;the grin of the great man was almost saturnine&mdash;&#8220;you
must be vur-ry careful how you interfere wi&#8217;
the liberties o&#8217; the Press.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN, at a quarter to three, the Mayor left the
Club, he linked his arm in that of Alderman
Murrell, whose famous shop stood cheek by jowl with
the City Hall at the other side of Market Square. As
they came slowly down the steps, both gentlemen had a
sense not merely of having lunched, but also of having
done ample justice to the affairs of the nation. But
amid the press of sharp realities into which they slowly
projected themselves, they were soon aware that the
affairs of the nation were still in the foreground of
the picture. Above Market Square a monstrous air-ship
still hovered, on whose Gargantuan belly the magic
letters U. P. were clearly visible. And at that moment,
dashing across the great Square itself, was a familiar
mustard-colored contraption, with the legend
&#8220;First with the News as Usual&#8221; flaring above it. The
news was heralded by a large placard hung at the tail
of the machine. &#8220;Aunt Mittie to address Charwoman&#8217;s
Conference&#8221; was its cryptic nature.</p>

<p>To the initiate, however, the &#8220;news&#8221; was not without
significance. And Sir Munt and the worthy Alderman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
were themselves at the brink of enlightenment. As
slowly and with a touch of pomp they descended the
Club steps, for the awed eyes of ordinary workaday
citizens were upon them, a shower of small white leaflets
fell from the sky. It was a part and only a trivial
part of the U. P. propaganda but the general effect was
remarkably like a stage snowstorm. Indeed, Sir Munt
emitted a quiet &#8220;very pretty&#8221; as he stooped augustly
to retrieve one of these handbills which had fluttered
and rotated to its long home at the bottom of the Club
steps.</p>

<p>Sir Munt always liked to speak of himself as a
<i>practical</i> man. Therefore, with an air of supreme nonchalance,
the chief magistrate paused amid the citizens
to adjust his eyeglasses.</p>

<p>The handbill gave the following information:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p class="center">TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION OF THE<br />
CHARWOMEN OF ENGLAND!!!</p>

<p>To-morrow (Thursday) Evening the
Delegates to the Charwomen&#8217;s Conference
will march to the Statue of John Bright in
the Great Market Square to demand a Compulsory
Pint of U. P. Stout with the midday
meal.</p>

<p>The Right Honorable Sir Augustus Bimley,
K.C.M.G., P.C., Britain&#8217;s First and Still
the Best Bookmaker M.P. will assume the
Plinth at nine o&#8217;clock precisely (weather permitting).</p>

<p>After the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop
of Blackhampton has offered a short prayer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
Dame Agnita Shrubsole, D.B.E. (&#8220;Aunt
Mittie&#8221;) will address the gathering.</p>

<p class="center">N.B. ENDOR MUST GO</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Very pretty!&#8221; Again Sir Munt paid involuntary
tribute. &#8220;Very nice, indeed!&#8221; He handed the leaflet
to his friend. &#8220;What do you think on it, Murrell?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Alderman adjusted a pair of gold-rimmed eyeglasses,
a replica of the Mayor&#8217;s, and read the document
with care.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charwomen don&#8217;t cut much ice, anyway,&#8221; was the
comment of Alderman Murrell.</p>

<p>The further-seeing man of affairs took him up
sharply. &#8220;Don&#8217;t make any mistake, my boy. Charwomen
have all got a vote these days, the same as
you and me. That&#8217;s where the fun comes in. Aunt
Mittie&#8217;s <i>Own Journal</i> sells its millions of copies a week.
And if you subscribe to it, you get reductions on everything
from a nightgown edged with Honiton lace to a
bottle of lime juice cordial. You can also ballot for
free tickets to the movies, the Christmas Goose Club
and the U. P. Burial Society. I tell you, my boy, you
get your money&#8217;s worth with Aunt Mittie&#8217;s <i>Own
Journal</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How they do it for twopence a week&mdash;that&#8217;s what
gets me!&#8221; The mind of the linendraper Imperialist
moved in a rather narrow orbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t do it&mdash;not on the paper. But what
they lose on the swings, they get back on the roundabouts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
And don&#8217;t forget this, Murrell, if it comes to
a showdown the U. P. can afford to lose on the swings
<i>and</i> on the roundabouts, because the cocoanuts, my boy,
will get them home every time. And why, Murrell?&#8221;
A touch of forensic passion had begun to work in the
veins of Blackhampton&#8217;s first citizen. &#8220;Because Mugs
like you and me are the cocoanuts. We are being
milked dry, my boy&mdash;we, the Middle Classes, the folk
who have a bit to lose and haven&#8217;t learnt to defend it.
The Charwomen&#8217;s Conference is up-to-date Communism,
my boy, with a certain newspaper Boss behind it
all. He and his Ring, who have corralled the country&#8217;s
power, are keeping the workers quiet by showing them
how to dip their hands in the pockets of you and me.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXIX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE news ran like wildfire through Imperialist
circles of the City that Sir Munt had &#8220;ratted.&#8221;
Moreover, the influence of a particularly honest and
forcible man was such that he threatened to carry with
him some of the acknowledged stays of his party. A
situation at once arose that was a fitting prelude to the
most significant by-election within living memory.</p>

<p>No matter what the moral defects of the prime
minister might be, he was a very old and sure hand
at the parliament game. His choice of John Endor to
throw down the gage of battle to the U. P. was almost
inspired. It might thunder up and down the land, but
there was no disguising that a prophet had arisen to
fight the cause of the oppressed Middle Class. John
Endor made a fine champion for the small trader, the
struggling professional man, and the people whose
moderate, fixed incomes were being taxed out of existence.</p>

<p>The U. P. did not take long to realize the danger of
its guns being spiked. Its batteries might thunder unceasingly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
the real issues might be obscured in a cloud
of poison gas, all its black arts might be called into play,
but from the start there was no burking the fact that
for once the Newspaper Ring was not going to have a
walk-over.</p>

<p>To begin with, it was soon apparent that Cosmos
Alley had shown less than its usual acumen in choosing
a candidate. At the first blush, Sir Stuyvescent Milgrim,
with his protection for key industries, preferential
tariffs within the Empire and other shining lures
for a purely mercantile community was &#8220;the sure card.&#8221;
But, as John Endor&#8217;s first meeting proved, the U. P.
champion was not well adapted to withstand the fire of
criticism that was suddenly directed upon him from an
unexpected quarter.</p>

<p>To the surprise of every politician in the City, the
chair at Mr. Endor&#8217;s first meeting was occupied by
Blackhampton&#8217;s Big Noise. For years Sir Josiah Munt
had held a unique position in its public life. He was
the friend of every good cause. If money had to be
raised for a worthy object, a piece of legislation demanded,
or a wrong denounced it was &#8220;as sure as
Monday morning&#8221; that Sir Munt in his own characteristic
fashion would sit at a small table with a tiny
hammer in his hand in the center of the platform of
the City&#8217;s largest public hall. Moreover, he would
bring the occasion home in a few words peculiarly his
own. In the art of &#8220;putting it over&#8221; he had locally no
equal. Disdaining mere grammar, verbal finesse, minor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
niceties of form, at all times he knew how to speak
man to man to the citizens.</p>

<p>At the Chairman&#8217;s table, Sir Munt was a formidable
proposition. He was very much a master man. And
from the outset of the fight for Blackhampton East,
the friends of Sir Stuyvescent Milgrim had to keep
the fact ever before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to some on us, gentlemen,&#8221; said Sir Munt, in
the course of his opening remarks, at Mr. Endor&#8217;s first
meeting, &#8220;that our Colonial friend with the old Yorkshire
name, who is so keen to help us over here, might
do almost as well in Ottawa, trying to persuade the
Land of Promise to give a square deal to people not so
happily situated. Some on us in this hall, who helped to
provide his country with the money that has done so
much to make her the proposition she is to-day, have not
forgotten her Government&#8217;s dealings with the Grand
Trunk Railway. Those of us in the city who happened
to hold the stock have not forgotten how its proprietors
were frozen out by penal legislation. I, for
one, gentlemen, intend to keep that little episode in
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was &#8220;some&#8221; beginning and when the Chairman
went on in the racy style in which all public meetings
delight, to give his opinion of the U. P. and the inevitable
result of government by newspaper, the first
fruits of which the country had already reaped, his
words fell as seed on a prepared soil. John Endor&#8217;s
speech was in a different key. His platform manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
had not the breadth, the force, the abounding humor of
the Mayor&#8217;s, but it did not lack &#8220;punch.&#8221; There was
a quality of voice, bearing and gesture which lent to
a deliberate, almost leisurely choice of phrase, a moral
conviction that drove every word home. The eye of
the seer and the fervor of the prophet when under the
discipline of the will seldom fail in their impact upon
an audience of average people which often has a flair
for just those qualities in which it knows itself to be
lacking.</p>

<p>John Endor&#8217;s first meeting produced a mighty reverberation.
It was heard all over the City. But it was
a mere prelude to the fight. And what a fight! The
&#8220;graft&#8221; that Sir Munt had feared came powerfully into
play. That amazing organization, the U. P., had its
unseen tentacles fixed very firmly in the vitals of the
nation. It was the biggest Trust in the world&#8217;s history,
beginning with the Government itself and filtering
down through every department of commerce and public
life to the smallest retail dealer and the humblest
newsboy. For their interest and good will it had something
substantial to barter.</p>

<p>The Universal Press was very popular. In the art
of saying the direct opposite of what it did it had little
to learn. It hurled the thunders of Jove against high
prices, the Capitalist Ring, the extravagance of Government
departments and oppressive taxation, but all its
private acts, under the rose, were directed to the fostering
of the very things it denounced in language so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
fiery. Behind everything was its fixed aim that the
many should bleed for the few. Lip service to democracy
was a profitable and delightfully simple game;
the many, of its very nature, is easy to gull. Not having
learned to think for itself, the word of its newspapers
is taken for gospel. And should trouble arise,
a dole from the pocket of somebody else can be relied
on as a rule to repair the mischief.</p>

<p>So great was the power of &#8220;the machine,&#8221; when it
came into play, that to the people of most experience
it was very doubtful indeed whether it was humanly
possible to defeat &#8220;the Ring.&#8221; The U. P. propaganda
was subtle and it was all-pervading. Its subscribers
were reckoned by the million, and, in return for countless
benefits, for the most part quite illusory, a modified
code of trade-union regulations was imposed upon its
members. Some genius of Universe Building had devised
a Roll of Good Citizenship. A certificate on
vellum was granted to all the world and his wife, to
whom in return for divers pledges, &#8220;the due observance
of which could not fail to be of immense value
to the State,&#8221; divers privileges were offered.</p>

<p>The art of creating public opinion had been raised
to a pitch unknown in the history of mankind. This
half-baked Democracy of the &#8220;movie&#8221; and the cheap
journal had an intellectual life wholly dependent upon
catchwords, of which its mentors had a never-failing
supply. None the less, the corps of registered and
scientifically organized subscribers to the U. P. was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
truly formidable body, who it was confidently believed
must turn the scale at any parliamentary election.</p>

<p>If you wore in your buttonhole a small purple disc
emblazoned with the Prince of Wales&#8217; feathers which
was given you in exchange for a year&#8217;s subscription,
paid in advance, to the <i>Planet</i>, the <i>Mercury</i> or any of
the thousand-and-one daily or weekly publications of
the U. P. throughout the habitable globe, you were free
of a great society which had the power of conferring
subtle and unexpected benefits upon you. With that
talisman in your buttonhole any retail grocer between
China and Peru was bound to take twopence off a
half-pound packet of U. P. tea. And There Was No
Tea Like It. The great ones of the earth, from the
Archbishop of Canterbury and Sir Augustus Bimley
to Rube Rooker, the pitcher of the Chicago Pinksox
and White Walker the Black Hope of South Dakota,
continually affirmed that inspiring truth in tube and
bus, in every newspaper, on every hoarding. There
Was No Tea Like It.</p>

<p>It was the same with U. P. cocoa, U. P. tobacco,
U. P. condensed milk, U. P. canned pears. If you
bought a U. P. reach-me-down you were entitled to
free membership of Blackburn Rovers, or Tottenham
Hotspur, or Old Trafford, or Kennington Oval, or the
U. P. Music Roll Society, or the U. P. Book Club,
according to your geographical situation and your natural
proclivities. Moreover, each purchase entitled
you to a coupon. And if in the course of a twelve-month<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
your coupons amounted to a given number, calculated
upon a nicely graduated schedule, you were entitled
to a new scale of benefits ranging from a freehold
residence in the U. P. Garden City, or a five-cylindered
U. P. automobile, to a free seat from three till five
every Sunday afternoon at the local U. P. moving picture
house.</p>

<p>These were material benefits. It was the aim of the
U. P. not only to make the world safe for democracy,
but also a Utopia for its subscribers to live in. If you
wore a U. P. hat, it had a bearing on your bus fare
between Cricklewood and East Finchley, or your tube
ticket from Barons Court to the Elephant and Castle.
If you required a set of false teeth or the best advice
in regard to an early divorce you took out a three-year
subscription to the <i>Planet</i> newspaper; if you merely
needed a safety razor or a pair of button boots with
glac&eacute; kid uppers, a three months&#8217; subscription to the
U. P. <i>Literary Digest</i> might meet the case.</p>

<p>With all the resources of a brand-new cosmos at his
back, a full-fledged U. P. parliamentary candidate was
indeed a proposition. John Endor and his friends realized
that from the start; but the character of the
contest and the nature of the odds nerved them for the
fight. The U. P. might weave its web, but John Endor&#8217;s
transparent honesty began to gain ground in spite
of all that its newspapers and its &#8220;graft&#8221; could do.
Blackhampton was the exact center of England in the
geographical sense and at moments of crisis in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
national life, when great decisions had sometimes to be
taken on inadequate premises, that fact generally reacted
on the minds of its citizens. In the local idiom
&#8220;they could see as far through a brick wall as most.&#8221;
And in the matter of a Stunt election it was well for
themselves and for the country at large that they were
endowed with this faculty. Otherwise, Sir Stuyvescent
Milgrim must have had a walk-over.</p>

<p>As it was, that gentleman and those who stood behind
him were soon alive to the situation. On the surface
everything seemed in their favor. The arts of the
U. P. were designed for such an occasion; few could
hope to stand against its peculiar blend of malfeasance;
but from the outset the personal equation came into
play. Endor himself was a born orator; the wife he
had so recently married, with her attractive presence
and her quick American wits, made a brilliantly effective
figure on his platform; and with the Mayor of the
City, that old idol of the populace to father them, they
formed a combination which in time and place was irresistible.
A John Endor meeting could always put
an enemy conventicle &#8220;to bed.&#8221; Nor in the matter of
&#8220;sideshows,&#8221; as Sir Munt called them, was the enemy
allowed to have things all his own way, as might have
been the case in an agricultural constituency or a dead-alive
cathedral city.</p>

<p>Blackhampton&#8217;s Mayor, having satisfied himself as
to where the truth lay, was not a man for half measures.
Promptly he set his hand to the plow. And it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
was set in grim earnest. The first manifestation of
this fact appeared in the sky.</p>

<p>On the night of the procession by torchlight, just
as the admired Sir Augustus Bimley was about to
address the Charwomen of England from the plinth
of John Bright&#8217;s statue, something went suddenly
wrong with that huge illuminated sky sign&mdash;Endor
Must Go&mdash;which made Market Square as bright as
day.</p>

<p>The Lord Bishop of Blackhampton was in the middle
of his prayer when the noble illumination which the
prelate had referred to as a light in a great darkness
began to fizzle. By the time the prayer was at an end
the light had gone out.</p>

<p>A feeling of anticlimax smote the gathering when
Sir Augustus Bimley rose to address it. Endor Must
Go had been taken at its word. The delegates to the
Charwoman&#8217;s Conference felt a sense of desolation,
which the fervent language they now heard could not
remove. Moreover, Britain&#8217;s Best, etc., was fairly under
way, his eyes in a fine frenzy rolling, when suddenly
there happened a strange thing.</p>

<p>The U. P. masterpiece in sky signs had not been
merely snuffed out; it had been eclipsed. But in a
literal sense it was now outshone. From above the City
Hall in gigantic letters there flamed suddenly forth
across Market Square the amazing legend:</p>


<p class="center">JOHN ENDOR IS JANNOCK</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>The effect was immediate; and it was dramatic. It
broke up the meeting. Indignation, moreover, ran so
high that it came within an ace of producing a riot in
the heart of the city. The friends of the U. P. candidate
so deeply resented having such an important
piece of their ordnance stolen and used against them,
that some of the more turbulent spirits needed persuasion
from the police to return quietly to their homes.</p>

<p>Next day the Blackhampton <i>Mercury</i> and other
U. P. journals sternly demanded a public inquiry into
the whole affair. None was needed really, for everybody
knew the cause. All over the City it was said
that &#8220;the Old Man had got at&#8221; the electricians, the
chief constable and the city engineer. In the statelier
words of the <i>Planet</i> newspaper, &#8220;Such an episode reflected
the deepest discredit upon the city of Blackhampton.&#8221;
All the same, it was a coup. The enemy&#8217;s
Long Tom had been audaciously taken from under its
nose. It was now being used with deadly effect by the
other side.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to bring to book the culprit-in-chief,
but it was not successful. Such a bird was
too old to be caught napping. And for some mysterious
reason the efforts that were made to repair the
mischief fared no better. In spite of every precaution,
the electric current of &#8220;Endor Must Go&#8221; failed night
after night, while neither the British climate nor untoward
circumstance was allowed to interfere with
the opposition sky sign &#8220;John Endor is Jannock.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>This sinister fact brought woe to the camp of Sir
Stuyvescent Milgrim. The moral effect was considerable;
the whole city was kept laughing. It was just
the sort of thing, said the U. P. agent, that was likely
to lose the election. In the meantime, the comedy of
the Firework Fizzle was worked for all it was worth
by its ingenious author. At every public meeting, in
alluding to it, Sir Munt was able to make new points,
while the original devisers of the stunt waxed more
furious. All kinds of analogies, humorously damaging,
were drawn from this affair. Soon all the world
began to see that every audacious stroke of badinage
was one nail the more in the enemy&#8217;s coffin.</p>

<p>Presently a whisper arose that the greatest and most
up-to-date of all Stunt elections was going to end, like
the wonderful sky sign, in a fizzle. Certainly that
fizzle had grown symbolical. The U. P. was in danger
of being hoist with its own weapons. Even the other
side&mdash;for generations Blackhampton had been notoriously
a &#8220;sporting&#8221; city&mdash;did not try to minimize the
humor and the significance of the case. At the end
of a week of nightly fiascos, while John Endor Is
Jannock seemed to wax ever brighter in the heavens
and its <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> more dismally waned, the sportsmen
of Blackhampton&mdash;even the dogs were held to be
sportsmen in Blackhampton&mdash;took a continual delight
in the affair. Sir Munt had surpassed himself. He
looked like winning the election off his own bat.</p>

<p>Blackhampton grew prouder than ever of its Old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
Man. He had an amazing faculty of &#8220;getting right
home.&#8221; And there were other shots in his locker. The
U. P. airships, hovering proudly above Market Square,
grew subject to mysterious deflations. But the greatest
coup of all, the Old Man&#8217;s masterstroke, was the
&#8220;running in&#8221; of Aunt Mittie, that voluble and truculent
lady, on a charge of brawling, and her admonition from
the bench of the City Hall.</p>

<p>As polling day drew on the fun grew faster and more
furious. Newspaper bombast, of which the candidate
of the Ring had a complete monopoly, could only be
countered by the simple truth. And the clear facts of
the case, presented with force and skill, were very effective.
It was all very well to obscure the issues at
stake by the arts of up-to-date journalism, but those
in touch with the situation soon began to realize that
what Sir Munt called &#8220;hot air by the cubit&#8221; had lost
its virtue.</p>

<p>John Endor, in the meantime, was adding daily to
the number of his friends. In the man himself there
was something British, forthright and sincere, which
did much to sustain the cause for which he was fighting.
That cause was the honesty of public life. Such
an ideal ceased to be possible the moment an all-powerful
Trust was allowed to govern the country through
its own nominees.</p>

<p>As defined by John Endor, there could be no mistaking
the issue. Much was at stake. Democracy
was not merely on its trial, it was fighting for its life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Could the shrewd sons and daughters of the Midlands,
lulled like so many of their kind by false catchwords
and pleasant sophistries, be roused in time from their
sleep?</p>

<p>The question was now being asked by the wisest
heads in the land. And a wave of relief flowed over
the country when it was known that the new Home
Secretary, his colors nailed to the mast in open defiance
of the U. P. and all its works, had been returned for
East Blackhampton by a majority of nearly five thousand
votes.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE fight won, John and Helen went back to London,
strong in a sense of victory. It was, of
course, the business of the Ring to minimize what had
occurred so far as it was able to do so. But facts are
stubborn things; an enhanced majority in favor of one
who had been bold enough to throw down the gage
of battle to the U. P. could neither be ignored nor
explained away.</p>

<p>At Westminster itself this could not be gainsaid.
There was no escape from the blunt truth that the incredible
had happened. The result of the Blackhampton
election brought dismay to more than one nominee
of the Ring on the Government benches. It was the
writing on the wall with a vengeance.</p>

<p>Still for the accomplished trimmer all was not lost.
He could still cling to his famous motto, &#8220;Nothing
succeeds like success.&#8221; Part and parcel of the race
of trimmers, flesh of its flesh, bone of its bone, it even
takes precedence of its other famous motto &#8220;Honesty
is the best policy.&#8221; &#8220;So glad, old man, you brought
it off.&#8221; Slap on the back. &#8220;Quite sure you would.&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
Grasp of the hand. &#8220;Downed the dirty dogs, eh?&#8221;
Punch in the ribs.</p>

<p>The blushing victor had much of this kind of thing
to endure in the first few days of his return to town.
He was in no sense a cynic, for his eyes looked steadily
towards the future, but even he was aware that the
most rejoicing voices were those which would have
been still louder had the cat jumped the other way.</p>

<p>Watching the cat jump, that art, too, was ever important.
Truly wonderful was the effect now wrought
upon the Mother of Parliaments. The Slippery One
had brought off the biggest thing since the Famous
Lie in the middle of that prehistoric period of the
Great War which had founded the fortune of more
than one grave and reverend parliamentarian and had
reduced the country to the verge of ruin. This new
stroke of daring had been so cunningly timed that its
success was said to be a masterpiece of strategy, a
triumph of tactical insight by those who would have
been the first to brand its failure, from whatever cause,
as a lapse into premature senility on the part of a mind
outwardly strong and vigorous.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilberforce Williams shared to the full in the
congratulations showered upon his brilliant lieutenant.
Some of the more volatile friends of the moment tried
to draw the prime minister as to the date of the General
Election which now was going to be a matter of
such vital concern to the world at large. But Mr. Wilberforce
Williams lay low and said Nuffin. He knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
Nuffin. It almost seemed in point of fact that Nuffinness
had been permanently emblazoned upon his politely
specious countenance.</p>

<p>In many dovecotes there was, all the same, a mighty
flutter. On the side of the angels, amid honorable
and right honorable gentlemen all over the House, there
was much anticipatory preening of feathers. The plain
English of the matter was the country would not stand
for a buccaneering war with China. Also there was
now a second vital consideration to face. Endor with
foolhardy courage had made the curbing of the U. P.
the first plank in his platform, yet the result had justified
him. The whole country was now alive to the
extreme peril of the Newspaper Ring and it was in a
mood for action.</p>

<p>Said the pundits, it would need a new constitution
to do it. But the super-pundits didn&#8217;t think so. Or
even granting that such was the case, there would be
no difficulty. Since the U. P. had taken the affairs
of the nation in hand, a new constitution could be
delivered every morning with the punctuality of the
<i>Planet</i>, the <i>Mercury</i> or the U. P. Milk in U. P. germ-proof
bottles.</p>

<p>John Endor was Home Secretary now. A man not
yet forty, with only a few years&#8217; experience of parliamentary
life, his rise had been singularly rapid.
Without being called upon to serve an apprenticeship
in a minor office, at one leap he had reached the Cabinet.
True, it was almost the worst Cabinet that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
ever misgoverned the country, but at its head was a
man of great abilities. And this man, faced with a
terrible menace to the world&#8217;s peace, was bent upon the
only remedy. Come what might, Saul Hartz, &#8220;the
secret power behind the throne of antichrist,&#8221; in the
picturesque phrase of John Endor&mdash;the prime minister
himself preferred the saponaceous to the picturesque&mdash;must
at all costs be broken.</p>

<p>To this end Mr. Williams, with discreet assistance
from the Crown lawyers, set himself to devise a Bill.
His task was not light, for directly or indirectly almost
every salaried official, not to say every wage-earning
person in the Island, was now affiliated to the Ring.
The measure was on lines long familiar in America,
but in &#8220;free&#8221; Britain it was something new.</p>

<p>The Wilberforce Williams Anti-Trust Law was designed
for the castration of the U. P. For that reason
it was doubtful if it would ever find its way to the
statute book. But as its sponsor mildly said, &#8220;There
is no harm in trying.&#8221; From the first, the prime minister
was extremely modest about this measure. For
one thing, personal modesty was the prime minister&#8217;s
long suit. On the Front Bench, on the platform, at
the dinner table, on the golf course, at an evening party,
he had always been so modest as to seem apologetic,
not to say deprecatory. &#8220;Really, my dear sir&mdash;to
think that I&mdash;of all people&mdash;should be asked to form a
government&mdash;why, my dear sir&mdash;you know as well as
I do&mdash;that the idea is positively&mdash;ah&mdash;ludicrous.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>Wilberforce Williams had raised self-effacement to
a fine art, yet somehow he had got there just the same.
While the Really Great Talents slept, the Slippery One
had climbed upwards in the night. And once in office,
although the fact was by no means clear to the world
at large, he was there &#8220;for keeps.&#8221; He had got in,
nobody quite knew how. With equal truth that formula
applied to the question of his getting out.</p>

<p>If Mr. Williams said little as to the prospects of his
Bill, as to its character he was reticence itself. The
most accomplished Cat-Jumpers, herded in solid phalanx,
tier upon tier, on both sides of the House could
get hardly a word out of him. Slippery Sam was not
exactly beloved, but since the Blackhampton Election
his stock as a political entity had risen. To have spiked
the U. P. batteries so neatly at such a fateful moment
clearly meant that W. W. had known how to read the
skies. Every professional legislator now began to
feel in his bones that one of the much dread periodical
reactions was at hand.</p>

<p>Could it be that the power of the U. P. was on the
wane? It had promised the Millennium and was doing
its best to deliver the goods, but it was so like
human nature to be in rather a hurry in these little
matters. The price of all commodities, &#8220;hot air&#8221; excepted,
was at an immoral height; unemployment, starvation,
suppressed communism were rife on every
hand; taxation was cruel, the depreciation of securities
went on and on; an all-pervading sense of disaster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
struck ever nearer the surface. The Millennium was
surely coming, all the morning and evening journals
said so, but in the meantime life for the ordinary rate-payer
was growing impossible. Yet, said the noble
army of Cat-Jumpers, with Blackhampton East now
before their eyes, the hour of deliverance is near.
Hence, the Anti-Trust Law! Hence, Down with the
U. P.! Hence, the pyramids!</p>

<p>In the present condition of Denmark it was unwise
to take anything for granted, but one fact was clear.
The country was in bonds, but a recent event had shown
that it was possible for its chains to be shed.</p>

<p>If deliverance was to come, however, it was now
felt that the task would devolve upon one man. John
Endor, in the opinion of the insiders, was that man.
His recent victory was a torch. It focused every
eye in the world of politics upon him. No one else
could have won that battle, at any rate in just that
way; and it became at once a talisman for all the
spirits by nature free, whom the degrading conditions
of modern political life were galling beyond endurance.</p>

<p>All things were possible now for John Endor. The
dragon which was crushing the life out of the nation
was not invulnerable. And one of the very few daily
newspapers outside the Ring which had any authority,
crystallized the feeling now uppermost in every perceptive
mind when it came out one evening with its famous
cartoon &#8220;The New Perseus.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MARRIED life could not have begun more hopefully
for John and Helen. They started housekeeping
in a tiny but charming house in Brompton
Square, the lease of which they had been able to acquire
on reasonable terms. It was great fun assembling
their modest household gods. These had to accord
strictly with their means; therefore, a case for taste
and discretion. But these were happy days. A high
faith in each other had been confirmed by the ordeal
through which they had just passed. Reputation was
in a measure theirs before the Blackhampton election;
but it was now enhanced, consolidated by a resounding
victory which filled the mouth of the world.</p>

<p>It was glorious to be young, to be strong, to be one
in dedication to a great task. Much would be demanded
of them. They must prepare to live laboriously.
Yet a vista had opened before their eyes.
Inspiration came to them hour by hour. During the
first few weeks of marriage it seemed to John Endor
that God was in His Heaven after all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>For both this was a time of growth. And yet, as
always, somewhere in the mind of Endor lurked a
pre-vision of things to come. A dark shadow was
seldom absent from his thoughts. Had it been possible,
he would have blotted from his life some recent,
brief, but horribly poignant passages. To none, however,
is it given to undo the past. In a moment of
weakness he had sunk to the level of an unclean foe.
He was pledged now to return felon stroke for felon
stroke. If he could but efface that hour of moral
failure what would he not give!</p>

<p>He dare not tell Helen his secret. By locking away
deep in his heart the memory of a tragic lapse he tried
to stifle it. But he was never allowed to forget that
it was there. Well he knew that the enemy would not
yield to dictation from anybody. Saul Hartz, upheld
by the power that had carried him so far, would dare
the Council of Seven to its worst.</p>

<p>John Endor saw all that with fatal clearness. And
soon there fell on him a black despair. &#8220;O ye of little
faith!&#8221; was the cry torn from him in secret as each
morning he opened his letters. The recoil of a famous
victory was far-reaching, as each day&#8217;s post brought
evidence. On every side, from quarters diverse and
unexpected, squires came forth with a demand for this
bold knight to lead them out to battle with the grisly
monster in whose toils the country groaned.</p>

<p>The hour was ripe. One of his power, his inward
vision, might lead them anywhere. He was beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
to make all the world see, as a Bright or a Gladstone
would have done, to what a pass the nation had
been brought. He had underrated the moral fiber of
his countrymen. In a moment of blindness he had
allowed himself to despair of the State&mdash;of that State
in which he so fully believed that he was ready to make
almost any sacrifice, in order to serve it.</p>

<p>What should he do? Saul Hartz was still Saul
Hartz, a being of volcanic will. And that will had now
become a creative force which seemed to transcend that
of men. In the mind of John Endor it was a symbol.
Here for one wrought upon by the fires of imagination
was the embodiment of the spirit that denied. But
if there was a God in the world, and the first weeks
of marriage, a time of rare happiness and sanity, had
taught him that surely there must be, He must be left
to deal with this monster in His own way, at His own
time. If Endor himself and the secret society to which
he was pledged usurped terrible functions which his
conscience could never approve, they, too, must sink to
the level of the thing they sought to destroy.</p>

<p>John Endor knew now that he was on the horns of
an inescapable dilemma. The body of fanatics and
visionaries whose will he had sworn to do would not
be in the least likely to release him from his vows. It
was not the way of such a camarilla. Once a member,
always a member. Before God he would have
to assume full responsibility for its acts. And that
knowledge was a viper in his breast. How could he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
hope to keep every nerve braced for the fight with such
a horror eating out his very life!</p>

<p>A little consideration of a state of affairs which
hardly bore thinking about brought home to John Endor
that there could be only one course for him now.
At all costs, he must cut loose from this <i>Vehmgericht</i>.
Likely enough it could only be done at the price of life
itself. But done it must be.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">MINDS there are of a psychic quality which seem
to anticipate events. John Endor had this sort
of mind. It hardly surprised him, therefore, when, on
the morning after his resolve had been made, he found
among his letters one summoning him to a meeting
of the Council of Seven. His inner consciousness, it
almost seemed, had grown aware that some such ukase
was on its way.</p>

<p>The time and place appointed were the Sunday following
at an old house in Kent. Roland Holles was
the owner of the house. And in the name of the
Society, he urged upon Endor in a private note
the supreme importance of the occasion. In no circumstances
must he fail to appear.</p>

<p>It so happened that Endor had another week-end
engagement. But with everything at stake, there was
but one thing to do. The prior engagement, of importance
in its way, simply had to be broken. Helen,
therefore, had to go to Cloudesley alone; she had,
moreover, to make the best excuses she could for the
eleventh hour default of her eminent husband. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
this was the more unfortunate because a number of
political and social big-wigs were foregathering at this
famous week-end trysting place in the Midlands in the
hope of meeting the new Home Secretary.</p>

<p>The odd circumstances of the case forbade any
explanation. And in the face of Endor&#8217;s general
evasiveness, it needed all the clear-headed loyalty of a
newly married wife to avert a first rift in the lute.
Beyond a few vague reasons which bore no analysis,
this sudden and unpardonable desertion had to be left
undefended. Not a hint could be given of the tragic
coil in which he was involved. It was indeed a test
of Helen&#8217;s faith to go forth alone among strangers with
a hastily improvised excuse for the nonappearance of
her husband.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning Endor motored down into Kent.
He was in a state of mental darkness as great perhaps
as any through which he had yet passed. Bitterly he
realized his folly. He was in a terrible morass. Now
that he was his true self, he saw that this Society, to
which he was bound by a most solemn oath of allegiance,
was itself a menace to the world. No matter
what the abuses it set out to destroy, to a mind of perfect
balance it hardly admitted of question that the
nostrum was at least as bad as the disease.</p>

<p>During a two hours&#8217; journey into the Weald of
Kent, he gave furious thought to the problem before
him. At all hazards he must free himself from the
toils of those whom he now felt to be inimical to society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
itself. But was it possible to get free? From
the note of urgency in the summons it was clear that
great decisions were about to be taken. And by the
oath that bound him he would have to accept a full
share of responsibility for those decisions whatever
they might be.</p>

<p>Busshe Court was Endor&#8217;s destination. A wonderful
old house, set in the very heart of &#8220;the garden of
England,&#8221; this first visit must have interested him
deeply had it taken place at another time. In the half-light
of a winter noon the place had an air of medieval
romance and mystery. Before a low stone portico
stood the owner of the house, who, without a hat and
in a suit of country tweeds, looked a typical and singularly
handsome English squire. Common report
said that Roland Holles wore more than one large bee
in his bonnet. So it might be, yet there was no denying
the picturesque force, the rather sinister attraction,
of a rare personality.</p>

<p>Endor met with a cordial welcome. The company
differed from the one gathered at Rose Carburton&#8217;s
eight weeks before. No women were there. Reckoning
Endor and his host, the company assembled at the
luncheon with which the proceedings began consisted
of seven men. Lien Weng and Bandar Ali, representative
of the immemorial East, were of the number;
and in the persons of George Hierons, Felix de Tournel
and Amadeo Negretti, there were also represented
America, France and Italy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>The talk at table in English was grave and copious
and informed. In agreeable contrast to the rather embarrassed
restraint of eight weeks before, when women
were of the company, there was now the freedom usually
to be found among men of a like way of thought.
The presence of servants in the room acted as a check,
it was true. Until they retired it was impossible to
approach the real business of that gathering, but the
talk, spontaneous and yet weighty, sustained, moreover,
by choice fare, did not flag.</p>

<p>Endor himself, an accomplished man of the world,
felt before this meal was half through that the men
about him had a depth of thought, a play of ideas, a
range, an authority beyond any he had met with. Had
he had a mind at ease it would have been a delightful
experience. Here it almost seemed, in the stimulus
of the hour, was gathered the salt of the earth. Yet,
in spite of the talk, the wine and the food, not for an
instant could he forget the terrible problem which confronted
him.</p>

<p>At the end of the meal, as soon as coffee and cigars
had been handed, the servants left the room. The host,
thereupon, called at once upon Lien Weng formally to
constitute the Court and open the session. This proved
a quite simple proceeding. These men, all more or
less familiar with the world of high affairs, well understood
the valuable art of dispensing with preliminaries.
So easy of manner was the President and so
adept were his methods that Endor to his deep chagrin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
allowed himself to be taken by surprise. With sharp
annoyance he grew aware that the business was actually
under way before he had even begun to attempt
to define his own position.</p>

<p>It was not a moment for hesitation. At the risk of
discourtesy Endor sprang to his feet. &#8220;I am truly
sorry to interrupt,&#8221; he said to Lien Weng, &#8220;but before
these proceedings are carried a step farther, please allow
me to say this. I have come here, not to transact
business, but to sever my connection with this Society.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speech, brief as it was, had the effect of a thunderbolt.
Every face around the table was anxious,
startled, incredulous. Lien Weng, alone, kept a perfect
impassiveness. He lifted his right hand delicately
and without a glance at the others, he said in his sweet,
cooing voice, &#8220;Sir, that is impossible. Believe me, sir,
it is quite&mdash;quite&mdash;quite impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor had foreseen even this blunt and final non possumus.
It did not deter him, therefore, from stating
fully his attitude. He admitted frankly that he
had entered into his vows at a time of mental and
moral overthrow; but now that his mind was established
once more on the plane of reason, he was not
prepared to go on with a thing that had lost the sanction
of his conscience.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear you cannot be allowed to withdraw, sir,&#8221; said
Lien Weng, softly. &#8220;Your vows were made on the
clear understanding that on no grounds conceivable
must they ever be broken. Once a member of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
Society of the Friends of Peace, always a member.&#8221;</p>

<p>An undercurrent of stern approval from those seated
round the table drove the plain words home.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that you say, sir, I recognized at the time,&#8221; said
Endor. &#8220;So much I freely own. But as I now wish
to make clear, owing to a cause which in a measure was
physical I was then suffering from an eclipse of the
moral judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lien Weng shook his head gently. There was a
brief pause. And then with the peculiar amenity of
a deep mind at grips with destiny itself, he went on
as if nothing had occurred, to expound the position the
Society had now reached in the matter of Saul Hartz
and the Universal Press.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ENDOR, from the first, had felt that he would not
be able to get free. And now, his protest made,
his own position fully disclosed, he saw that for the
time being, at any rate, there was nothing more that
he could do.</p>

<p>In the moments that immediately followed, a mind
cruelly torn became a house divided against itself.
One part of his brain, wherein lurked the eternal verities,
assured him that this illicit assembly, this Council
of Seven, was no place for John Endor. And yet in
another part of his ethos, an influence, alien, but of
extreme potency, was also at work. The cold logic
of the matter was that on the issue that had been raised
Lien Weng and his associates were perfectly right. In
a matter of this kind, no man could be permitted to
forswear allegiance. That was only just and fair.
And it was reasonable that one who did so must pay a
full penalty. The question of questions now for John
Endor, or at least for the political part of a mind-at-war,
was how, when, in what fashion must the penalty
be paid?</p>

<p>If, following at once upon his protest he withdrew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
from the deliberations of the Council, he put himself
irrevocably out of court. On the other hand, if he
stayed where he was and bore a part in its transactions,
he would be committed by implication to any
act upon which it might decide. The problem for a
man faced with such a far-reaching issue was almost
insoluble, but, after a moment of intense emotion, some
deep instinct of policy called upon him to remain.</p>

<p>The hour which followed in the beautiful but
smoke-laden Busshe Court dining room had an entrancing
interest for John Endor. Nothing could have
been more severely business-like than the methods of
the Council of Seven. In a few words, chosen with
much skill, Lien Weng made everything quite clear.</p>

<p>Saul Hartz had ignored the recommendations of the
Society of the Friends of Peace and the period of grace
had now expired. And, in accordance with the rules,
by which all present were under a solemn pact to abide,
this man, a direct menace to the peace of the world,
must die.</p>

<p>The Seven differed in one instance from the body
which had adjudicated recently in the matter of William
Garland, the notorious Labor Leader, who had
chosen also to defy the Society. D&#8217;Alvarez, better
known as El Santo, upon whom had devolved the task
of doing Garland to death, had carried it out successfully.
He had therefore been granted from these deliberations
the release, which by the laws of the Society,
he was entitled to claim. In his stead appeared the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
Society&#8217;s most recent and not least important recruit,
John Endor.</p>

<p>So much, in a brief summary, Lien Weng made
clear. It now remained for the seven men sitting round
the table to devise a means of doing Saul Hartz to
death. In such cases the practice was, under a veil of
strict secrecy to draw lots as to who must bear this
terrible burden.</p>

<p>The procedure was for each member of the Council
to write his name on a slip of paper, fold it up and
place it in a small black velvet bag. After this receptacle
had been shaken by all in turn, the last comer to
the deliberations of the Council was allowed to draw
one name from the bag. It was then shaken again
by the six members whose names remained, and then
the person whose name had been drawn was required
to take from the bag a second slip of paper. Upon this
was to be found the name of him who in accordance
with the Society&#8217;s rules must do its will.</p>

<p>As soon as Lien Weng had explained what the procedure
was and before any part of it could be set in
motion, John Endor rose a second time to speak. He
now addressed himself mainly to George Hierons the
American, and to his own countryman, Roland Holles.
In the stress of the moment he did not hesitate to appeal
to them as fellow members of the Anglo-Saxon world,
men of his own race and blood, white men, men of
western training and ideas to whom such proceedings
as these must be subversive in the last degree.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>The appeal, brief as it was, had all the cogency of an
orator finely skilled in the art of appealing to the emotions.
Speaking with absolute conviction, his words,
it was clear, made a considerable impression upon those
to whom they were addressed. The Frenchman and
the Italian also felt their impact, but Lien Weng and
Bandar Ali could not conceal a deep resentment in
spite of the mask of calm politeness with which they
tried to cover it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believing as we do,&#8221; were Endor&#8217;s final words,
&#8220;that this man, Saul Hartz, is the incarnation of evil
and that he is a threat to the future of mankind, I
am now convinced that the only true way of removing
this dark shadow is to set in apposition to it the idea
of God. Eight weeks ago, when I took my vow, for
the moment I had lost my vision of the Eternal. It
has now returned to me and I see that, as at present
constituted, the Society of the Friends of Peace, albeit
inspired by the highest of all human motives, cannot
hope to achieve its aim.&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor&#8217;s protest made, he sat down again at the
table. He must now abide the issue. Clairvoyantly
he awaited the slow unfolding of an odd ritual. The
proceedings began with curious solemnity. As the
latest member of the Council of Seven, the task devolved
upon himself of drawing from the velvet bag
the first slip of paper.</p>

<p>Should he or should he not bear his part? It was a
momentous decision to have to take. But there shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
through his mind a clear perception of the fact that
there was really no alternative. He was under oath
to obey the rules of the Society or pay the heaviest
penalty of all.</p>

<p>One glance at the faces around the table told him
quite plainly that the penalty would be exacted. These
men were not to be trifled with. He would die like a
rat in a trap. And such an exit would not save Saul
Hartz, nor would it help the future of mankind.</p>

<p>On the spur of the moment Endor had to decide.
By a withdrawal now from the Council of Seven he
would gain nothing and yet he would lose his life.
Was he ready to lose it? Was he ready to lose it
without a struggle for the vindication of his ideals?
Automatically, yet with a subtle sense of coercion from
the powerful minds around him, he dipped his hand
into the velvet bag and drew out one of the slips of
paper.</p>

<p>Unfolding the strip with a feeling of irresponsibility
a little bizarre he found that on it was written the
name George Hierons.</p>

<p>The rules now required that upon the American
should devolve the duty of taking from the velvet bag
the name of him who was called to a dreadful task.</p>

<p>A hush fell upon the table. In a silence that
was physical torture to more than one around that
bright mahogany, the strings at the bag&#8217;s mouth were
pulled tight, and then the bag itself was handed to
George Hierons.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>In this moment of exquisite torment, it was as if
something broke inside John Endor&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>Even before the second slip was drawn from the
bag, and the name it bore was made known, Endor
realized, as if by the magic of an occult power, that
in an especial manner Fate had marked him down.
Before the impassive American opened this paper and
announced its contents, the latest member of the Council
saw and heard his own name:</p>



<p class="center">JOHN ENDOR</p>

<p>When seconds later that name was pronounced, he
gave a little gasp. He felt the burning eyes of the
others envelop him. Overcome by emotion, he was
unable to meet those eyes and bent his own to the
table. A nausea of dismay bereft him of the power
to think or act. But all too soon there came to his
ear the calm and precise speech of Lien Weng.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Endor,&#8221; said the President in a small soft
voice, not unlike a cat&#8217;s purr, that turned to ice the
blood of the man whom he addressed, &#8220;you are called,
within the term of eight days, reckoning from this
Sunday midnight, to kill the man Saul Hartz by the
method ordained in such cases by the Council of Seven.
What that method is, it is now our duty to reveal.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XLIV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">FROM the depths of his gorgeous robe, Lien Weng
took a small gun-metal case. A spring released
the top. Within was a tiny glass phial, in the form
of a syringe, containing about an ounce of a colorless
fluid. So delicate was the whole contrivance that it
could be concealed in the palm of one hand.</p>

<p>After Lien Weng had placed it on the table in front
of him, he went on to explain its nature and its use.</p>

<p>The fluid was the most subtle and the most deadly
poison science had yet evolved. Distilled in minute
quantities by a recent chemical process from a rare herb
indigenous to the Manchurian wilds, the secret was
known to the Society alone, and its use was strictly regulated
by its laws. In operation, as Lien Weng explained,
it was very simple. By discharging the contents of the
phial on the back of a person&#8217;s coat, of no matter
what thickness, at a point midway between the shoulder
blades, it would percolate in the course of less than
three hours to the spinal marrow. And, without warning
of any kind, it would bring about a sudden and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
complete collapse of the nervous system. Death would
at once ensue and not leave a trace of its cause. So
subtle was the work of this poison that it defied all
medical diagnosis. Its operation was impossible to detect.
Autopsies were vain. The police of London,
New York, Bombay, Shanghai could only surmise that
such a thing existed without being able to prove the
fact. Indeed they were faced by a problem with which
they could not deal; a problem so elusive that it merged
cause in effect.</p>

<p>Succinctly and gently, with the air of a British judge
addressing a British jury, Lien Weng expounded all
this to John Endor. He was required to use the lethal
weapon formally entrusted to him now by the decree
of the Council of Seven within the time appointed
and in the manner specified.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if, sir, one does not choose to carry out this
horrible task?&#8221; said Endor, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; was the President&#8217;s soft reply, &#8220;since you
have taken the oath of our Society is it really necessary
for me to answer your question?&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor looked earnestly at the faces of the six men
around him, as if he would peer into their minds.
Again he was undecided as to what his immediate
course of action should be. His first thought was to
defy these fanatics by flinging the phial into the fire.
But as his fingers closed upon the slender tube of glass,
the mysterious <i>prana</i> deep down in every healthy nature
intervened to save him. An overt act of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
kind, as the faces around told him very surely, would
mean certain death.</p>

<p>At the call of an obscure law of being Endor slowly
returned the cylinder to its gun-metal sheath. And then
fully sensible of six pairs of eyes fixed upon him,
he took from his breast pocket a cigarette case and
calmly placed within it this most deadly of weapons.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, you have until to-morrow Monday week at midnight,&#8221;
were Lien Weng&#8217;s final words.</p>

<p>Once more Endor looked at the circle of faces around
him. Of the thoughts they concealed he could glean
nothing beyond a covert hostility in the eyes of Bandar
Ali and a look of deep anxiety in those of George
Hierons. The American was seated next to him. At
this terrible moment, in which Endor knew that his
own death sentence had been pronounced, and even
in this most dangerous company, he was not without
a friend.</p>

<p>As Endor got up from the table he felt upon his arm
a slight pressure, soothing yet magnetic. It was as if
that gentle touch spoke its own silent message, &#8220;For
heaven&#8217;s sake, my friend,&#8221; it seemed to say, &#8220;do nothing
hastily. Let your slightest action now be the
fruit of wisdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of this tacit prayer, Endor yielded to the
all-powerful desire now in his mind. He would fly
at once from this house of ill omen. Before he left
the room, however, he was moved to speak again.</p>

<p>&#8220;One last word!&#8221; As Endor reached the door he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
turned swiftly to face the men who were still seated
at the table. &#8220;I believe,&#8221; he said, in a voice strained
and thin, &#8220;that Providence itself has given me a means,
a lawful means, of breaking this malign power which
you would have me unlawfully destroy. You, who at
all costs are pledged to conserve the peace of the world,
cannot hope to gain your end by secret murder. I beg
you to give me a chance to prove that the Divine Will
is working for us and for all mankind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The passion of this last appeal drew no response
from the six men at the table. Mutely impassive they
watched that rather wild figure withdraw from the
room.</p>

<p>Endor at once ordered his car. He was bent on
going back to London immediately. Not another hour
could he endure the fetid air of Busshe Court.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">HELEN, meanwhile, was spending the week-end
at Cloudesley. And here, too, in the famous
Midland home of a great political magnate, certain
strange things happened.</p>

<p>To begin with, Mrs. John Endor had to make the
best excuses she could for the non-arrival of her distinguished
husband. He had &#8220;chucked&#8221; at the last
moment, and it was not easy to forget that fact. The
party was large and made up of heterogeneous elements.
But more than one of its members had looked
forward to spending a certain amount of time in the
interesting company of the new Home Secretary. Keen
disappointment was expressed by host, hostess and
guests alike. Helen&#8217;s excuses for the absentee sounded
in her own ears rather hollow, but she had tact enough
to make them sound convincing in the ear of others.</p>

<p>All the same, her brief Saturday afternoon to Monday
morning sojourn in a huge barracks of a house
was to prove a particularly trying ordeal. Not that
there was any lack of creature comforts. But the ordeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
might be said to begin shortly after seven o&#8217;clock,
just as she was about to ascend the famous white marble
staircase to dress for the evening meal. For it came
to Helen like a veritable blow to behold Saul Hartz,
newly arrived, stride with an air of calm proprietorship
into the entrance hall.</p>

<p>At the sight of him, her heart gave a leap. This indeed,
was a bird of ill omen. She had not in the least
expected him to be there. Not that there was any reason
why he shouldn&#8217;t be. He had the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to nearly
every house in England; and in most the art of the
<i>charmeur</i>, great when he chose to use it, and his range
of information made him a more than welcome guest.
To Helen, however, it simply had not occurred that she
was likely to meet him. As disconsolately she made
a slow ascent of those imposing stairs, she could have
wished that the new Home Secretary had followed the
practice of Royalty by demanding a list of the people
who had been invited to meet him!</p>

<p>To add to Helen&#8217;s embarrassment, it fell out that
the Colossus took her in to dinner. She would have
given much merely to avoid talk with him or even the
lightest contact with his arm. Yet surely this was
Fate. And from Fate there can be no appeal. At the
moment he crossed the room to claim her with a bow
and a smile, she felt in her bones that this meeting
had to be.</p>

<p>Since John had told her of the diabolical aspersions
this man had cast upon her good name, they had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
met. In spite of all that she owed Saul Hartz, and
she still felt it was much, her resentment was deep,
just, implacable. Pride forbade the showing that her
wound was still raw, but she could not help letting him
see, even had she had the wish to prevent it, that she
was now in the thrall of an icy antagonism. And yet
with what mastery, what subtle art was this man able
to toy with her fine feelings!</p>

<p>At the dinner table he was irresistible. She sought
escape at first by turning quickly to a pompous and
monosyllabic politician seated at the other side of her.
But that didn&#8217;t answer. Even more than usual Saul
Hartz was dominant. When he liked to exert his great
powers, he was the most compelling man she had ever
known. The fact that he saw beyond his kind gave
barbs to his wit, a depth to his insight, spice to his
knowledge, a form to his philosophy.</p>

<p>When this man unbent, there was none like him.
Helen once again had to render him that justice. With
that strange, remote whisper he could dominate half
the large room if he chose; or if, as he now preferred,
he chose to confine himself to the young and singularly
attractive woman at his side, she, too, must yield to
its mystic spells.</p>

<p>The Colossus was never more the Colossus than this
evening. All about him were mainly strangers&mdash;he
was a man of many acquaintances and no friends&mdash;and
no doubt there were secret enemies in their midst,
but he paid them scant regard. He was willing, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
than willing, that &#8220;his dear Helen&#8221; should claim it all.</p>

<p>She fought against him, but it was no use. He
spread before her the jewels of his mind and her soul
was dazzled. Ever and again, the thought recurred to
her that there was none like him. None could there
ever be. If demigods there were, to-night Saul Hartz
was of their kin.</p>

<p>From the very hour of their first meeting some two
years ago at his office in New York she had felt the
sense of his power. And now hating him implacably
as she did and as she must, he seemed to be raised to
a power yet higher. His will, his courage, his imagination
made her think of him now as a latter-day
Haroun-al-Raschid. But he was something more. He
saw beyond the Beyond. To Helen, as he revealed
himself in the course of this unforgettable evening,
he was like one who had rifled a sealed envelope and
read its forbidden contents.</p>

<p>His talk in its abandon was that of one who cares
for none of the world&#8217;s standards. It was the talk
of one who defied God and man; of one who looks beyond
experience; of one who saw so much that he
accepted nothing. Deep in the heart of Helen was a
desire to pity him. He was indeed a figure for pity.
A noble mind was straining its moorings. Chartless,
rudderless it might soon be out in an open sea.</p>

<p>In the two months that had passed since she had
last talked with Saul Hartz, a subtle change had taken
place in him. Something had happened to the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
himself. Those hooded eyes still veiled their fires,
but in the face to which they lent a luster and a value
was the look of death. With a flash of vision it came
upon Helen that the Colossus was now living in its
shadow.</p>

<p>That fact, if fact it was, explained the man to-night.
He seemed to know that the end was near. And it
was as if he was trying not to care. After all he had
had a pretty good inning. He was only fifty-four, still
in the prime of his years as other men reckoned them,
but a single year as the Colossus lived it was more than
a lustrum for those of normal chemistry. Measured
in terms of achievement, brain tissue, dynamic power,
the fifty-four years of Saul Hartz could be multiplied
by ten.</p>

<p>Slowly, with a stealth that at first she did not perceive,
the spell of an old fascination came again upon
Helen. She did not forget his depth of wickedness.
With a shudder that had a tinge of joy she recognized
that the mind and will so delicately enfolding
hers did evil for the love of evil; but yet she felt, too,
as she had always done, that there was nothing ignoble
in his choice of the baser part. At the worst, it belonged
to a false philosophy of life. It was part of his
giantism, his lust of power for power&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the silly gnats&#8221;&mdash;a big wine was in his glass&mdash;&#8220;all
the silly gnats who swarm in bus and tube, who
line up in queues for theaters and movies, who devour
bookstalls and live on our headlines, well, well! One-hell-of-a-muss,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
isn&#8217;t it, my dear? No place for people
as sane as you and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was left a little stunned by the logical ferocity
of a mind so modern, and yet so subversive of all things
that seemed to make life livable.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XLVI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER dinner, in the privacy of an inner drawing
room, Saul Hartz sought Helen again. It was
agony almost for her to be with him, to hear his strange
voice clothe yet stranger words; and yet it was a form
of experience that no constructive mind would ever
willingly forego. She was a woman of strong will, a
woman sound in heart and brain, but of a sudden there
returned upon her the memory of that night of subtle
fear, some two months back, when she had paid a
surprise visit to Carlton House Terrace&mdash;that unforgettable
night of his dealing the man she loved a felon&#8217;s
blow. Not then had she known him for the thing he
was. For her, at least, his purpose was still masked.
But now everything was clear. The hood had lifted,
the veil was rent. He stood forth, open and declared,
an enemy of mankind.</p>

<p>The knowledge filled Helen with curious emotion.
She now felt the challenge of his nature in a way that
frightened her. Beside her sat the very genius of negation.
Was not she, too, just a poor silly gnat? The
sense of his sheer animal power made her almost long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
at this moment to feel his arms about her; with his
sorcery upon her she half wished that his lips would
crush out her life. And she knew that she was powerless.
As he sat very close to her in that cushioned
nook, she might have been under the spell of a fabulous
monster. Shivering with fear, she began to realize
that her defenses were failing. Raised to this pitch,
such a creature was all that had been, all that could ever
be. Somehow she felt that the old prophecies were
true. The living, sentient being whose hand now held
hers was the incarnation of Evil.</p>

<p>Was he, to whom in the past she owed so much,
about to amuse himself in the r&ocirc;le of Don Juan? Pray
heaven he would be content to-night with that of Lucifer!
Oh, why had she come to this house? Oh,
why had she come there alone?</p>

<p>She felt the touch of a cool palm on her lightly clad
knees. It brought riot to her brain a hint of madness.
She tried to free herself, but laughingly he pinned her
down. If she could but get away! Held by his will
she could hardly move or breathe. Was it possible,
despite all she could do, that he was about to make good
his vile boast of two months back? Where was the
God in whom she believed? One part of her mind
besought that Friend who for her had always been at
the back of everything, while the other part glimpsed
the joys of surrender to one who had declared war
upon authority.</p>

<p>With an insight which she felt to be terrifying, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
Colossus was able to read her thought. To him the
human mind was an open page. Looking deep into
those honest eyes he smiled at the naked terror that
he saw there. With a softness more than feline he
began to stroke the delicate fabric of cr&ecirc;pe de chine that
so inefficiently covered her. &#8220;If I ask you to put
your arms about my neck and kiss me, what will you
do?&#8221; Not by the lips was that speech uttered, but by
eyes that glowed and burned like those which glow and
burn in jungle grass.</p>

<p>She tried again to get away. But with the flick of a
paw he cast her back to her cushions and held her.
&#8220;One can never understand,&#8221; he purred with an odd
gentleness whose effect upon her was as wine and
music, &#8220;why a creature of your intelligence, and particularly
a woman, should ever truly believe that Right
must triumph and Wrong must fail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One does believe it, all the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>His laugh drove the blood from her heart. &#8220;And
that is so amazing! Look at this horrible world we
live in for our sins, and tell me quite honestly if there
is any evidence at all of a power more benign than an
impersonal, blind, animal force? The wind blows, the
clouds rain, the stars shine. Some of us who are geared
high smoke big cigars and own newspapers; some of
us, geared not so high, are women broken in body and
soul, whose daughters are on the streets and whose sons
have been condemned by the State to the battue. So
much, my dear girl, for this God of yours! On this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
little planet, you can&#8217;t tell me, He is making any headway
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt as if he had hit her in the face. &#8220;I do
believe,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;And&mdash;and&mdash;no matter what
happens&#8221;&mdash;his grip was on her shrinking knees&mdash;&#8220;to
me&mdash;or to mine&mdash;I shall go on believing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I shall go on disbelieving.&#8221; He chuckled
softly. &#8220;All the same, I like your pluck!&#8221; The father
was speaking again to a favorite daughter. Helen
shivered at the intolerable memories wrought by that
tone. &#8220;How well you fight with your back to the wall.&#8221;
He raised her hand in his and pressed his lips upon
it lightly. &#8220;I respect your courage.&#8221; Voice and
smile grew even more paternal. &#8220;And between ourselves,
that is the only thing in the life one knows that
one does respect. Courage. That alone is sacred. Courage.
No matter when, no matter where one meets
that, one pays homage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smiling at his thoughts, he got up from the sofa on
which they sat. As he stood before her in the arrogance
of his mental and physical power, she could not
kill a sense, try to stifle it as she would, that here perhaps
was the noblest thing on which her eyes had
looked.</p>

<p>He still kept close track of her mind. &#8220;Bless you,
dear child!&#8221; She felt his eyes pass through her like
a sword, and she bit her lip in an agony that had a
touch of ecstasy. And then came terror again. She
fought against a sob she could not control. Hearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
it, he sighed tenderly. &#8220;One mustn&#8217;t hurt you too
much,&#8221; he said, half to himself. &#8220;You&#8217;ve always been
a particularly nice girl. I have always liked you.&#8221; His
voice had grown gentle, charming, whimsical. &#8220;Good
luck. <i>Bon voyage.</i> You are a good woman. Your
husband is a good man. And I am a very, very bad
one. But please remember that it is against all experience
to suppose that the bad people don&#8217;t come out on
top. Believe me, they always do&mdash;and they always
must.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT night Helen slept little. Her talk with Saul
Hartz had proved cruelly disturbing to the mind
and to the emotions. She was haunted by it. For
hours she lay awake thinking of this man who had
played so strange a part in her life. Seeing him now
as the thing he truly was, her fear of him was unnerving.
It troubled her that they should be under one
roof. She had an insurgent desire to seek at once the
safety of her home. There could be no rest for her
until she had returned to that haven and to the man
she loved.</p>

<p>Much of the next day, Sunday, was spent in active
dread of the Colossus and a desire to avoid him. Helen
mixed freely with the other guests. She went to
church in the morning, she played bridge in the afternoon
and by every means that was open to her she took
precaution against being caught unawares. The last
thing she desired was another <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with Saul
Hartz.</p>

<p>In her present emotional state she was met with one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
harsh fact. For some reason she was now the prey
of a secret fear. An unknown force had invaded her
life. Suddenly the future had become an abyss. To
such an extent was she possessed by a sense of the impending,
that it was as if a sword was about to fall.</p>

<p>What this menace could be she was without means
of knowing. But it was surely there, a phantom perhaps
of an overdriven brain. At least Helen hoped
that it might prove no worse than that. Certainly as
far as she was aware, it had no ground in reason or
logic, and was, therefore, without the stay of fact.</p>

<p>Color, however, was lent to this new fear in a rather
odd way. Among her fellow week-end guests was a
man named Wygram. The personality of this man
excited Helen&#8217;s curiosity. She had never met any one
like him. A rather exotic, oriental appearance seemed
to lend value and emphasis to his views on occultism,
mental telepathy, thought transference and kindred
subjects which were now so much in the air, and upon
which, in an unobtrusive way, he seemed to be a veritable
mine of information.</p>

<p>After Helen had spent an entrancing hour in talk
with Mr. Wygram, she gleaned from her hostess by
dint of judicious inquiry that he was now recognized
the world over as an authority upon the Unseen. She
learned further that this remarkable man had found
a solution to more than one mystery that seemed impenetrable
and that the police often had recourse to
his services.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>This view of Wygram&#8217;s unique powers was supported
by the attention paid him by Saul Hartz. It
was never a habit of the Colossus to flatter the vanity
of his fellow men by sitting in public at the feet of
Gamaliel. But it was clear to Helen that the orientalist
had some potent attraction for him. More than
once in the course of that day she saw the two men
together in quiet corners. And to judge by the look
of concentration on Mr. Hartz&#8217;s face the subject of
their talk was to him of vital concern.</p>

<p>At dinner, no doubt as a concession to the keen curiosity
Helen had shown in regard to Mr. Wygram, she
was taken in by him. Further acquaintance did but
add to the interest he excited in her. Little passed
between them that average people could have laid hold
of as definitely enlarging the boundaries of human
knowledge, but Helen felt all the same that her approach
to certain subjects whose importance and value
she could but vaguely surmise would from now on be
more practical, more scientific, more expert.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far do you think it possible,&#8221; she ventured
to ask, &#8220;for one mind, or for a group of minds, to act
subconsciously upon the mind of another person, without
coming into direct contact with it, in order to control
its actions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An interesting speculation!&#8221; Wygram spoke with
the simple candor of one very much a master of his
subject. &#8220;I think myself the science&mdash;and as one happens
to know, a dark and terrible science it is, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
the East has already brought to an uncanny perfection&mdash;of
imposing one&#8217;s will upon the will of another is
being developed to a point which threatens some very
ugly developments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what one feels oneself,&#8221; said Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the other day,&#8221; said Wygram, &#8220;I was called
in by the New York police to help in a terrible case
which has made a great impression over there. It was
that of a man, otherwise presumably sane, who committed
a perfectly senseless and illogical crime because
a deadly enemy, an expert practitioner of the new
science, had been able to tamper with the mind of that
man subconsciously while he slept.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dreadful!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wygram agreed that the speculations opened up by
a fact so sinister were not pleasant. &#8220;The whole world
is on the down grade,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Man has played
things up too high. For many years he has been dealing
with unclean things&mdash;subtle poisons, high explosives,
black magic. But to my mind this new science
which has come out of the East is the worst of all, because
it is by far the most elusive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it be used, do you suppose, on a large scale?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fear is that it can be,&#8221; said Wygram, &#8220;and
that it will be. An unlucky signalman the other day at
Hellington had a lapse of memory. The London express
ran into a goods train that was being shunted
out of a siding. Such a thing, in normal circumstances,
should never occur. By reason of it, sixteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
people were killed and sixty-eight injured. Among the
killed were the Chancellor of the Exchequer and a Judge
of the High Court. Accident, says the world. A rub
of the green, say the directors of the railway company.
Fate, say the newspapers. Call it what you
will, but at the point the perverted mind of man has
now reached, who shall say what the real cause was?
Perhaps a certain very distinguished Chinese thinker
now in this country might be able to throw a new light
on a terrible occurrence.&#8221; At the look of horror in the
eyes of the woman at his side, Wygram paused. &#8220;Mind
you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;one does not for a moment accept all
the implications that such a theory may open up. Let
the possibility be advanced just for what it is worth.
And I think&#8221;&mdash;his voice grew very gentle&mdash;&#8220;it would
have been kinder, and perhaps wiser, not to have advanced
such a possibility at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your studies have made you pessimistic,&#8221; said
Helen, hoping this was a straw to which she might
cling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I quite think so,&#8221; Wygram agreed. &#8220;Every
mind becomes subdued to that in which it works. But
I do feel that human life was never exposed to so
many hidden perils as to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One feels that, too,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;Indeed,&#8221;&mdash;she
shivered slightly&mdash;&#8220;the truth of that somehow strikes
to one&#8217;s marrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke, she was sharply aware that the man
at her side was looking at her with a grave curiosity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;Forgive the question,&#8221; he said, in his soft voice,
&#8220;if it should seem impertinent,&mdash;but do you say that
as a private member of the community, or as the wife
of a man to whom so many eyes now turn in the hope
that he may be able to do a great and much needed
work for us all?&#8221;</p>

<p>Girt by the thought that Saul Hartz was at another
table and that no fragment of their talk was likely to
reach his ear, Helen confessed that she was now
haunted, not so much on her own account as on that
of her husband, by a great fear.</p>

<p>Something in her manner seemed to impress Wygram
deeply. &#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he said, in a voice hardly
above a whisper, &#8220;just what it is that you fear in regard
to him in the near future?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too vague to be put into words,&#8221; said Helen,
anxiously. But again she shivered, and again Wygram
looked at her with his questioning eyes.</p>

<p>He forbore, however, from pressing the point further.
So sharp was her distress that he gave the subject
an adroit turn, and did not refer to it again. But
this talk, all the same, made a profound impression
upon Helen.</p>

<p>Next morning she breakfasted early, at the beck of
a strong desire to catch the first possible train. London,
her home, her husband were calling her. A second
night of very little sleep had made Cloudesley and its
surroundings almost intolerable. She was oppressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
by a sense of being urgently needed elsewhere. Hour
by hour, a conviction had gained strength in her mind
that something was about to happen to John.</p>

<p>Perhaps &#8220;the something&#8221; had happened already.
Who could say? An obsession seized her that such
was the case. At all events, the breaking of his engagement
for the week-end, without being able to give
a reason, a proceeding altogether unlike him, lent color
to this new and harsh belief. Both Hartz and Wygram,
men whose every word meant much, had dropped
more than one hint that her husband was in the toils
of ineluctable fate.</p>

<p>Helen could not hope for peace of mind until she
was back in Brompton Square. And soon after half
past eight, as she crossed the hall to the car which was
to take her to the station, with every thought fixed
upon getting away from this hive of unpleasant memories,
a simple thing happened which yet seemed to
add tenfold to her fears.</p>

<p>Wygram, who was just coming down to breakfast,
intercepted her at the foot of the stairs. &#8220;Good-by,
my dear Mrs. Endor,&#8221; he said, in a cordial tone. And
then in one much lower, but of vital urgency, &#8220;Take
care of your husband. The world has need of him.
And if in the course of the next few days you feel you
must have a friend whom you can really trust, please
remember your compatriot, George Hierons, who, I
believe, is still in London. It may be, of course, that
the need will not arise. Sincerely one hopes it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
not. But if it does, consult him. Again, good-by!&#8221;</p>

<p>These cryptic words did not lessen Helen&#8217;s alarm.
More than ever she was convinced that something had
happened or was about to happen to the man she loved.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XLVIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was within a few minutes of one o&#8217;clock when
Helen reached Brompton Square. Of the maid who
opened the door she inquired eagerly for Mr. Endor.</p>

<p>The fever of her mind was such that it felt a keen
relief from the mere fact of John being in his room at
work. She flew to him. But the feeling of joy left
her the moment she entered the room. He was pacing
heavily up and down in a way that brought to her mind
a wild animal in a cage. His hands were clenched
behind him, and his eyes, rather weird in their intensity,
lent a look of strangeness to a haggard face.</p>

<p>So strong was the thrall upon him that even Helen&#8217;s
sudden appearance in the room did not cause him to
throw it off. She could hardly bear to see his face.
It was that of a man whose nerves had been deranged
by the sight of a ghost. Indeed, when he stopped at
last and turned towards Helen, there was something
in that face which seemed to drive the blood from her
heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling!&#8221; she gasped as her hands clasped his coat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
&#8220;tell me&mdash;tell me what <i>is</i> the matter? Why do you
look like that? What awful thing has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not answer. She repeated the question with
a tenser anxiety. &#8220;What <i>is</i> the matter? Do tell
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to do so. In the urgency
of the moment he did what he could to keep back the
truth. But at the best, it was a lame, clumsy, half-hearted
effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think you may have caught a slight chill motoring
into the country yesterday?&#8221; An explanation so
feeble could but add fuel to Helen&#8217;s incredulity. Something
far beyond that poor excuse was called for by
those wild eyes and ashen cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I&#8217;m really ill,&#8221; he managed to say. But
the voice was not his. Hollow, spectral, thin, it might
have been a ghost&#8217;s.</p>

<p>She knew that he was ill indeed. Eyes of despair,
now palpably shrinking from contact with hers, told
her too clearly that he was suffering from a grave
malady. Moreover she knew he was trying his utmost
to conceal the fact from her.</p>

<p>Suddenly her eye lit on a sheet of foolscap lying on
the carpet. In the agitation of the moment it had
drifted, no doubt, from his writing table. It was covered
with recent writing which had been left to dry.</p>

<p>As Helen picked up this document, she glanced at it,
almost without a thought of what she did. A swift intuition
told her that this was no ordinary paper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>He had been making his will!</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; He tried for a light and whimsical
inflection, with which to turn aside that startled accusation.
The failure to achieve it was complete. In fact,
it was so complete that in the ear of Helen it sounded
rather ghastly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something awful has happened,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I feel
sure of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The alarm in her eyes, her note of fierce conviction,
was becoming too much for him. Even if he owed
it to her to carry the thing off bravely, in a fashion
that would spare her infinite pain, he soon began to
realize that in his present shattered state such a task
was beyond him.</p>

<p>For the time being, she was stronger than he. Face
to face with death he had made up his mind to accept
it with stoicism, but the importunity of the woman
he adored overcame him now. At first, he had been
fully determined to tell her nothing. The concealed
rock which had shattered a fine career should remain
undisclosed. But he saw that it would be inhuman
to meet death in silence and in secrecy, even had such
a course been feasible.</p>

<p>How much should he tell? That was his problem.
She was his wife, and had a right to know all. He
had made, it was true, certain solemn vows. But these,
as he now saw, had been entered upon in an evil hour.
Therefore, he must break these vows and pay for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
privilege with his life. But the question remained,
how much would it be expedient to tell her?</p>

<p>One fact he did not doubt. Enemies, terrible and
implacable, would be ranged against him. And if they
should once suspect that their secrets had been divulged
to Helen, her life, too, would not be worth a moment&#8217;s
purchase.</p>

<p>In spite of that, however, embarked on his strange
story, he found it beyond his power to withhold any
material detail. It became a sheer impossibility to
choose or select. All had to be known, once the die
was cast. Listening in grief and horror to a narrative
of events which began with John&#8217;s rooted conviction
that the world was now at grips with a terrible
evil, Helen was yet able in some measure to impose her
will upon the man she loved. A deep instinct told her
that the only hope of saving his life lay with her; and
if so frail a chance was to be fruitful, she must acquaint
herself with all the strands of the coil in which
he was involved.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XLIX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AT the end of a story which, halting and fragmentary
as it was, took some time to tell, Helen felt
shattered. Deprived of the power to act or to think
consecutively, all the force of a strong will was needed
to sustain her. The awful Nemesis which had overtaken
a phase of passing weakness in a good and
brave man struck at her heart; but in the end it was
perhaps as much as anything the sense of Fate&#8217;s injustice
that roused her fighting spirit.</p>

<p>With all the facts of the case before her, and once
the control of her nerves had been regained, Helen
soon made up her mind. Be the cost what it might,
her husband&#8217;s life should not be thrown away. By
nature and temperament a woman of action, she was
accustomed to reach quick and bold decisions. And
in the moment her resolve was taken it was fortified
by a sudden recollection of Wygram&#8217;s final words.
&#8220;If, in the course of the next few days, you feel you
must have a friend whom you can really trust, please
remember your compatriot, George Hierons, who, I
believe, is still in London.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>Such words seemed truly prophetic. And as they
came back to Helen&#8217;s mind, she was upheld by a deep
faith that John and she were not to be abandoned in
this hour of strife against the powers of darkness.
Providence was surely at their side. It was working
for them. Counsel and sympathy had come to her
mysteriously, but she recognized the source whence it
sprang. Behind the phenomena of appearances there
was somewhere a Friend. And that Friend, whoever,
whatever it might be, she felt was going to help them
now.</p>

<p>Luncheon was a miserable and belated meal. For
both it was but a hollow pretense. They were in such
a febrile state of anxiety that the mere presence of
food was almost unbearable. But seated at the table,
crumbling bread and sipping water, Helen was able
to do a certain amount of thinking. At the end of
this Barmecide feast, when she rose and left the dining
room, a kind of plan was already taking shape in
her mind.</p>

<p>All the facts of the case, which with infinite difficulty
she had been able to drag out of John, were
now more or less clear. They were marshaled in
definite order, they fell into a logical scheme. It now
remained for her to act without an instant&#8217;s delay upon
the data she had so painfully gathered. And yet to
move at all in such a matter called for rare courage,
high devotion.</p>

<p>At his wife&#8217;s entreaty, Endor went down to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
House of Commons as soon as luncheon was over.
Her clear good sense, upon which he now leaned heavily,
saw that for him in so terrible a crisis the paramount
need was to keep at work. She divined that the only
chance he had of holding on to the will was to occupy
himself as much as possible. In such a crisis any form
of brooding or inaction would be fatal.</p>

<p>For her, anything of that kind would be fatal, too.
She must not look before or after. It was like crossing
an abyss on a narrow plank. Her resolve taken,
her plan formed, one pang of indecision might
paralyze a nerve upon which all chance of safety depended.
And she must act without an instant&#8217;s delay.</p>

<p>She listened for the click of the front door. And
then from the discreet ambush of the charming new
curtains of that singularly pleasant room, in which so
lately as two days ago, each individual object had been
a thing of delight, she watched her husband&#8217;s tall and
picturesque figure disappear round the corner of the
Square into the Brompton Road. Then she went to
the telephone at once and rang up Freeman&#8217;s Hotel.</p>

<p>It seemed an age before her demand to speak with
Mr. Hierons could be met. A voice was not sure
whether Mr. Hierons was now staying at the hotel,
but it would find out. He had been away some days
and the voice rather fancied that he had not yet returned.
Minutes passed. And then in the midst of a
baffled impotence that was almost a fever now, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
Helen&#8217;s unspeakable relief, a tone she faintly recognized
said, &#8220;Are you there?&#8221;</p>

<p>George Hierons was speaking. If Mrs. Endor cared
to come round at once to the hotel he would be glad
to wait in for her.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">L</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ON the way to Freeman&#8217;s Hotel in a taxi, Helen did
her best to remember that she still lived and
moved and had her being in twentieth century London.
She tried hard to keep all the simple and familiar realities
before her mind. Everything looked so oddly different
now from what it had done less than three
hours ago when she had driven west from St. Pancras
station, that such a ritual seemed necessary. She was
plunged in a state of affairs whose fantastic horror it
was hardly possible for a mind so sane as hers to exaggerate.
It was like living in a nightmare, except
that it was much more vivid. But when everything
around, the rattle of the taxi, the London mud, the raw
air, had convinced her that she was truly awake, she
might have bartered her immortal soul to believe otherwise.</p>

<p>George Hierons, who was living <i>en suite</i>, received
Helen in his own private sitting room. He greeted
her with a cordial tenderness which could only have
sprung from the regard of an honest and a good man.
Yet hardly a glance was needed to tell her that not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
little of her own acute distress was shared by a true
friend.</p>

<p>The face of George Hierons was that of a highly
sensitive man who was suffering acutely. His visitor
was struck by a tragic change in his appearance. Eyes
and cheeks had deep hollows, their lines a look of age
that mere years did not warrant; and underlying a
strong and beautiful face was a torment of pain, stifled
and repressed, that Helen could not bear to see.</p>

<p>She had the courage to begin with a conventional
remark. But Hierons at once made clear that there
was no need to withhold anything. He took her hands
gently in his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done a wise thing in coming to see me,&#8221;
he said without a word of preface. &#8220;Tell me just
how much you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen hesitated. John had revealed much as to the
workings of the Society, but he had been careful not
to disclose the names of its members. She had strong
reason to suspect that Hierons belonged to it, but until
she was quite sure it would be the height of folly to
lay her cards on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may tell me all,&#8221; he said, reading her thoughts
without difficulty. &#8220;I was with the Council so recently
as half past eleven this morning&mdash;if it is any
satisfaction to you to know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is to say you belong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, again taking her hands.</p>

<p>She could not hide the look of frank horror that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
came into her eyes. Her impulse was to draw away
from him as if he had been a thing unclean. Man of
fine perceptions as he was, he yielded instantly to her
emotion, not trying to combat it, but stepping back a
pace with a slight bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he said in a low voice, &#8220;the stake we play
for is the highest there is. All that we do, all that
we have done, all that we hope to do, is dictated by the
faith that the peace of the world depends upon us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you still believe that?&#8221; asked Helen, looking at
him steadily.</p>

<p>He did not answer at once.</p>

<p>With an insurgency of feeling, an odd tightening
of her throat and breast, she repeated her question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is still our position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You honestly think,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;that evil can be
met with evil? You think that murder can prevent
murder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In certain extreme cases,&#8221; said Hierons, &#8220;we hold
that view. The Church has failed, Christianity is a
back number, one after another the higher moral sanctions
are going by the board. Human society is very
sick indeed. Only a desperate remedy can save it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen looked bleakly at Hierons. But she didn&#8217;t
speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;The root of the trouble,&#8221; Hierons went on, &#8220;is that
it is still in the power of certain people, of one man if
you like, to unchain forces more terrible than the earth
has yet known. This unlucky planet of ours is entering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
upon a new phase. Unless steps, drastic and immediate,
are taken to bring under control those who
now govern it, the human race may soon be faced with
a catastrophe beside which all its other catastrophes&mdash;and
Heaven knows what they have been in the immemorial
past!&mdash;may appear of small account.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grim intensity of her countryman&#8217;s earnestness
kept Helen silent. He paused a few seconds that she
might say something, but she chose not to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I intend to take you fully into my confidence,&#8221; said
Hierons with the childlike simplicity of a great mind.
&#8220;Our Society which we believe to include the flower
of the world&#8217;s creative wisdom takes no narrow or partial
view. It sees the human race now at the mercy of
a particular type of brain and that type is peculiarly
ignoble. It sees other and finer types, developed on
lines less grossly material, with but little chance against
this archetype whose gospel is the cynical application of
brute force. The weaker or more delicate types&mdash;so
far as our Society can read world tendencies&mdash;are
fighting a losing battle with their backs against the
wall. In other words, so far as this unhappy time is
concerned, Evil is stronger than Good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t it always been so?&#8221; said Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;More or less, I agree. But human ingenuity has
now entered a phase which is a direct menace to evolution
itself. Never has it been so imperative that those
who do evil for the love of evil should be brought under
control.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;that control can only be acquired
by invoking the spirit of Right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True. And our Society, odd as the fact may seem
to the uninitiate, exists for that very purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen&#8217;s face showed a frank incredulity. &#8220;You
would have one believe,&#8221; she said, with a thrill of horror
in her voice, &#8220;that people are murdered secretly
in the name of the Most High?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Murder is a harsh word. But as you say,&#8221; Hierons
went on in a stern, solemn tone, &#8220;the Society&#8217;s every
act is dictated by the aim it has in view. &#8216;God moves
in a mysterious way His wonders to perform.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To me,&#8221; said Helen with a little gasp of horror,
&#8220;that sounds very like blasphemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; said Hierons. &#8220;Consider the problem
the world has now to face. It is all very well to say
that faith will move mountains, but when Good is
being done inevitably to death by the massed forces of
Evil, it is for those of us who dare to believe that the
world may yet be saved for mankind to use to the best
of our skill what weapons the stronger power may have
left us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or to put it in another way,&#8221; said Helen, who was
following a singular argument closely, &#8220;believing as
your Society does that this earth of ours is now ruled
by the spirit of Evil, in order to restore the balance
of power it is necessary in the most literal fashion to
break the Sixth Commandment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Hierons. &#8220;But only in the last resort.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
And such are the basic conditions which now govern
the world that no other alternative is left to the Friends
of Peace. Let us take a concrete instance. Saul Hartz
has the power with the terrible machine he controls to
bring about war between Britain and America. And
the best informed people firmly believe that he will
do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should he? The power of the Universal
Press is almost as great in one country as in the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True. And there&#8217;s the rub. The American Senate
has recently decided to take strong action against
the International Newspaper Ring. Certain trust laws,
more or less obsolete, are going to be revived and rigidly
enforced. The Colossus is now in a position to
fight them and is preparing to do so. And say the
wise, so that his will may prevail, he must presently
force a fratricidal conflict which may plunge the entire
world in darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You really feel,&#8221; gasped Helen, &#8220;that he has that
power?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly. All the strings are in his hand. He
has brought to perfection the art of fouling public
opinion at its source. And rather than this &#8216;unthinkable&#8217;
war&mdash;his favorite newspaper phrase!&mdash;shall come
to pass, with hell loose in the very air we breathe, with
famine and pestilence on every continent, and damage
irreparable to all forms of organic life, it were better,
say the wise, for the human race to close down altogether.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>&#8220;But surely all this is surmise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would that one might think so. For those who
have eyes to see, the designs of the Colossus in 19&mdash;
are just as clear as were those of Wilhelm II in the
years prior to 1914. That is why the Society of the
Friends of Peace is determined at all costs to remove
Saul Hartz before a second and greater disaster overtakes
this unlucky world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen was silent. Extremists, tinged with fanaticism,
these people might be, but as Hierons presented
the facts of the case, and once granting its premises,
there was no gainsaying the hard logic of the whole
matter.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">A SOLEMN pause followed. And then Hierons,
with rather an air of taking the bit between his
teeth, went suddenly on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fate has ordained that your husband shall do a
thing which we, his friends and co-workers, humbly
believe to be the will of God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be your view,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;It may be
the view of your Society. But it is not my husband&#8217;s.
And he is quite ready to give his own life rather than
take, as he believes unlawfully, the life of another
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Council yesterday,&#8221; said Hierons, &#8220;your
husband made a similar statement. And, my dear
Mrs. Endor,&#8221;&mdash;deep feeling suddenly fused the voice
of her countryman&mdash;&#8220;I have to say this: We, the six
members of the Council who were present, were most
profoundly moved by the appeal your husband made
to us. The strength of his position in England at this
moment we fully recognize. Upheld by a recent victory
against enormous odds, he believes that he is
called to a great work for the state. He believes that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
as far as Britain is concerned it is now possible to
rally public opinion to a perception of the awful danger
that lurks in the unbridled power of certain inimical
forces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he not given proof already,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;of
what he can do? What other man in this country
could have won the Blackhampton election in the face
of the U. P.?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hierons deferred to the force of that argument.
&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the Council of Seven grants all
that. It is the last to close its eyes to the hard fact.
But the Society of the Friends of Peace, governed of
necessity by a set of iron laws, has not the power to
absolve any member from his vows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there then no way out for my husband?&#8221; asked
Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apart from the death of Saul Hartz, I am afraid
there is none. Once a decree has been promulgated by
the Council, the Society is bound to stand or fall by
it. But let me say this: The Council is so deeply engaged
with the great question your husband has
raised&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;That the remedy is at least as bad as the disease,&#8221;
Helen interjected quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;Even if we don&#8217;t go with you quite so far as that,
your husband&#8217;s words yesterday to the Council have
already sunk deep. And I may say that it has appointed
me to wait upon Mr. Endor in the course of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
to-morrow, so that, in its name, a certain proposal may
be laid before him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A vivid light came into Helen&#8217;s eyes, as she asked
what the proposal was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it first be made to your husband,&#8221; said Hierons,
in a tone kind and gentle, &#8220;before I disclose it to you.
He may or may not feel at liberty to accede to it.
One hopes sincerely that he will. And in any event
it may help to lessen his doubts, by convincing him of
the absolute <i>bona fides</i> of those whom he now stigmatizes
as visionaries and fanatics. In the meantime,
my dear Mrs. Endor, keep up your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">HELEN, alas! returned uncomforted to her home.
She had little hope. Grateful indeed for the true
and real consideration George Hierons had shown her,
a single conversation with him had yet proved that he,
too, like all the members of the group to which he belonged,
was an extremist.</p>

<p>At breakfast next morning, John, who was haggard
and overstrung from loss of sleep, told his wife casually
that George Hierons was coming to see him on
business at eleven o&#8217;clock. Helen, from a natural desire
to avoid a subject that was almost a menace to
reason itself, had not mentioned her own visit to Freeman&#8217;s
Hotel. And so far as John knew, she was not
even aware that the American was a member of the
Council of Seven.</p>

<p>Avoid the subject as she might, Helen could not
overcome a devouring curiosity in regard to Hierons&#8217;
morning call. Was there still hope of a way out of
this impasse? At best it could only be tenuous. Knowing
her husband for the man he was, she felt sure that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
he would not yield a point without the full assent of
his conscience.</p>

<p>On the stroke of eleven Hierons arrived. He was
shown at once into the small room in which John Endor
did his work. At the moment his visitor came in
Endor was writing a letter. Rising at once with a
formal greeting, he knew by the grip of the American&#8217;s
hand and his warmth of tone that he might count on
his friendship and sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I come from the Council,&#8221; said Hierons briefly and
without preface.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I understand,&#8221; said Endor in a voice that betrayed
no emotion. &#8220;Lien Weng wrote last night telling
me to expect you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he mention the proposition I bring to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hierons was silent a short time. And then he said
abruptly: &#8220;By the way, did your wife tell you of the
talk we had yesterday afternoon at my hotel?&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor said that she had not spoken of it.</p>

<p>Hierons, diplomatist that he was, now began to proceed
with caution. &#8220;After you had put the general
position before your wife&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;Say rather that she dragged it out of me,&#8221; said
Endor with a wan smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;she came to me. And having due regard to
these difficult and peculiar circumstances I took her
to some extent into the Society&#8217;s confidence. Knowing
so much, it seemed best, I think, that she knew more.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
Therefore, I would like her to hear what I have to say
to you now. The whole position is so irregular that
one feels her presence in this room will not do any
harm. Moreover, at the point we are now approaching
it is just possible that she may be able to help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor, however, was loath to consent. Already he
regretted the fact that his wife knew so much. Surely,
it had been wiser and kinder to have kept his own
counsel. Such a matter was bound to distress her terribly.
And the pain it must cause would serve no end.
This was an affair in which he was sure that her good
will could not possibly avail.</p>

<p>Hierons, all the same, persisted in his request. For
a reason of his own he greatly desired that Helen
should be present. And in the end John, much against
his own judgment, allowed Hierons to prevail.</p>

<p>Endor went himself to fetch his wife.</p>

<p>Helen, for her own part, was only too eager to hear
what the emissary of the Council of Seven had to say
to her husband. Having learned so much already, she
had now a burning desire to know all. Nevertheless,
her hope was small that a way of escape from a terrible
dilemma could be found.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS far as the grim matter now in hand was concerned,
Hierons was the soul of business. Perhaps
he may have realized that if his task were not
instantly performed he might not be able to accomplish
it.</p>

<p>When Helen entered the room, the American at
once opened the ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am desired by the Council of Seven to say this:
As soon as the death of Saul Hartz has been accomplished,
the Society will consider its immediate aim to
have been achieved. It will no longer seek the world&#8217;s
peace on its present lines. In fact, it proposes at once
to annul its constitution; as a corporate body it will
cease to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Society is about to disband?&#8221; said John Endor,
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;as soon as Saul Hartz, the world&#8217;s arch enemy,
is dead. The transactions of the last few days
have convinced some of the Society&#8217;s deepest thinkers
that the cause of humanity as a whole will be best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
served by the Friends of Peace going to work in other
ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There I am with it,&#8221; said Endor. &#8220;Yet, may I
ask, what does it propose to do with the strange and
terrible secrets it possesses?&mdash;secrets which, it seems
to me, must always imperil the very thing it has been
called into being to safeguard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before the Society passes out of existence,&#8221; said
Hierons, &#8220;it will appoint certain trustees; and to these,
under strict legal forms, will be intrusted the great
discoveries, so dangerous to mankind, which it has been
the first function of our Society to control.&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor, keenly following every word, expressed his
approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place, as you may know,&#8221; Hierons went
on, &#8220;it was because of the discoveries made by certain
chemists and scientists, among whom I have the honor
to count myself, that the Society of the Friends of
Peace was first called into being. From the outset
we realized that having had the good luck or the ill
luck&mdash;one hesitates to say which&mdash;to evoke such powers,
it became our duty to control them rigidly. For that
purpose, we formed ourselves into a kind of International
Conscience, on lines not dissimilar to the ill-starred
League of Nations, which failed, as one is
bound to believe, mainly because of the short-sighted
policy of my own country. That, however, is still a
sore subject upon which we won&#8217;t enter here. To return
to our Society, it was born when some of us realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
that the science of destruction had become such
a dire menace to mankind that something must be done
to keep its latest achievements out of the hands of any
one particular government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the reason, I presume,&#8221; said Endor, &#8220;that no
individual government, in such a world as the present,
could be trusted to wield such powers rightly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One is interested to know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We owe it to you, my dear Endor,&#8221; the American
continued, &#8220;that our Society now sees that it has been
working on wrong lines. The wisdom of using its
own terrible secrets to enforce its aims has, some of
us think, very properly been called in question. Before,
however, the Council of Seven abolishes the
present constitution it insists that its decree in regard
to Saul Hartz be carried out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor dissented strongly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; said Hierons, &#8220;that position is not illogical.
The death of this man is on all grounds desirable. He
stands condemned in strict accordance with laws to
which you have yourself most solemnly subscribed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, I know,&#8221; said Endor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moreover, the task falls upon you. And the means
are in your hands. Nothing could be simpler or easier
than what you have now to do. Will you not help
us all by fulfilling your oath?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite impossible,&#8221; said Endor. &#8220;No one
could welcome the limiting of the Society&#8217;s functions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
more earnestly than myself, but rather than take the
life of another, in such circumstances, I am fully prepared
to take my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All of us,&#8221; said Hierons, &#8220;are particularly anxious
that your life shall not be sacrificed. We recognize
that in the immediate future it is likely to be of signal
use to the world. But, unhappily, there can be no going
back on the Society&#8217;s laws. The Council of Seven
is bound to insist that its decree be carried out within
the time appointed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by me,&#8221; said Endor, flatly. &#8220;That cannot be.
And, as I say,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I am quite ready to accept
the alternative. It is no more than a just penalty for
tampering with forbidden things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that the world can ill spare you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is a true estimate of one&#8217;s worth, it is for
the Council of Seven not to forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hierons glanced furtively at Helen, who stood pale
and rigid, a figure of tragedy. The silence which ensued
was painful to all three. And then Hierons said
suddenly, &#8220;Tell me, where do you keep the phial that
was given you by Lien Weng?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, my friend.&#8221; With a cool laugh that had a
note of defiance, Endor pointed to a safe at the other
end of the room. &#8220;That is the only place for such a
diabolical contrivance. No wonder,&#8221; he added, &#8220;that
the Society of the Friends of Peace has been able to
give the police cold feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hierons agreed. &#8220;But please,&#8221; he said, &#8220;do it the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
justice of remembering that in the first instance it was
formed to meet the situation to which this and kindred
discoveries have given rise. And please remember,
also, that we of the white races, although this particular
discovery is not really ours, are determined to the utmost
of our power to keep it under strict control.&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor smiled sadly, and shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awful possibilities have been opened up, I grant
you, but, please God, the world at large may trust those
whom the Society shall choose not to fail in their task.
I hope you agree that such a task is safer in private
hands than in those of any government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder!&#8221; said John Endor.</p>

<p>A further long pause followed. And then George
Hierons said, in a tone which in such circumstances
seemed rather careless, &#8220;If you are not going to make
use of the phial you had better give it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor looked keenly at the American. &#8220;In order,&#8221;
he said, choosing each word with care, &#8220;that you may
use it in the breaking of the Sixth Commandment?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hierons did not deny that such was his intention.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, my friend,&#8221; said Endor, decisively. &#8220;I
cannot aid and abet you in doing that which I will not
do myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is surely extreme,&#8221; said Hierons, with a
touch of impatience. &#8220;Please give me the phial that
I may do with it as I choose. Even if there was time
to procure a second phial before the term expires, the
laws of the Society make it impossible for one to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
so. The code which governs the use of this weapon
is very rigidly enforced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to know that such is the case,&#8221; said Endor,
grimly. &#8220;And I fully appreciate your own courage
and self-sacrifice. But, as I say, I cannot help you
or any one else to do that which my conscience will
not sanction my doing myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be quixotic,&#8221; said Hierons, with growing impatience.
&#8220;As far as one can see, this is the only possible
way out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor, however, was a rock. &#8220;I cannot, I will not,
lend myself to cold-blooded murder. It is true that
at a time of severe overstrain, I made certain vows.
And it is true that I have chosen to break them. But
having done so deliberately, I am now ready to pay
a full price for the privilege.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a finality of tone moved Helen to tears. Hierons,
also, was deeply affected.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to think of others,&#8221; said Helen, piteously.
&#8220;The world must not lose you. Does your
life, your work, mean nothing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor raised his hands to his face with the gesture
of a man driven beyond his strength. But he did not
speak.</p>

<p>As Helen and George Hierons stood watching him,
a sense of utter despair came upon them. They now
shared in common a desolating thought. Even in a
world in which Good was submerged, it seemed possible
to pay too high a price for the hope of dethroning
Evil.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">HELEN and the American had a sudden craving
for fresh air. For both the restriction of four
walls had grown intolerable. Endor&#8217;s wife begged her
friend as he was leaving the house to let her walk with
him some of the way towards his hotel.</p>

<p>Hierons readily assented.</p>

<p>Devoured by pity for a brave woman, he was also
devoured by pity for a brave man. Loyal as he was
to the Society which he had sincerely believed to be
necessary to the world&#8217;s governance and which he had
done as much as any man to call into being, he saw now
that its methods had been pushed too far. But with
bitterness of soul he realized that he could do nothing.
Like Endor himself he was caught in a tragic coil of
Fate&#8217;s weaving.</p>

<p>The morning was fine, the pavements were dry, and
the sky was reasonably clear for December in London.
For some time they walked in silence. They had become
great friends, these two. There was more between
them than the tie of nationality. On vital issues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
their minds marched together. Their outlook on
life was the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;This horrible coil,&#8221; said George Hierons at last,
&#8220;began first to be woven when America declined to
enter the League of Nations. Her arguments, at the
time, were no doubt strong, but she was not able to
see far enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen sighed. &#8220;To me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the inability to
see far enough begins to seem the universal tragedy,
common to each individual life and to the life of every
nation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hierons agreed. And he added with an air whimsically
prophetic: &#8220;Man being as he is in the world
that we know, it is a tragedy for which there can be
no remedy. Even the wisest people have to improvise
their actions from day to day, without knowing or
being able to guess what their re-percussion will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly they walked along Knightsbridge, past Hyde
Park Corner into Piccadilly. As they approached the
Ritz, which was on the other side of the road, the eyes
of both were most oddly caught by a sight that held
them fascinated.</p>

<p>They had grown alive to the fact that Saul Hartz
was stepping off the pavement immediately in front
of them. In spite, almost in defiance, of a flux of
traffic, the Colossus made a bee line for the opposite
side of the street. With a glossy silk hat tilted at
a rather rakish angle, the fur coat of the plutocrat
and an umbrella with an ivory crook depending from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
his right arm, his progress almost into the very jaws
of the swift-moving buses and motors was so arrogant,
so inhumanly cool, as to be sublime.</p>

<p>Oddly enough the thing which really fixed the eyes
of the two spectators was the umbrella with the ivory
crook. It hung so negligently from the arm of the
great man that just as he was about to put off to the
farther shore it threatened to drop from its perch.
With a quick motion Saul Hartz re-grappled it to his
arm.</p>

<p>Helen and George Hierons, their eyes and thoughts
in the spell of a single image, halted for nearly a
minute, yet without speaking a word, to watch the Colossus
cross the wide road and enter the hotel. Still
without speaking, but with an unforgettable picture in
their minds, they resumed their walk as far as the
corner of Dover Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for bearing with me so far,&#8221; said Helen
offering her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come and have lunch somewhere?&#8221; said
Hierons.</p>

<p>Helen declined the invitation. She frankly owned
that food was very far from her thoughts just now.</p>

<p>Both were suffering. The American kept Helen&#8217;s
hand a moment in his own. &#8220;I shall be at my hotel,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;for at least another week. You have only
to communicate with me at any time and I will come
to you at once&mdash;if there is any chance of my being of
the slightest use.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>She thanked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the meantime,&#8221;&mdash;his quiet voice deepened to
intensity&mdash;&#8220;we who share great and unhappy secrets
must keep close together in the thoughts of one another.
We can but watch out in the hope that somehow&mdash;somewhen&mdash;a
sign may be given.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen was not able to speak. A single tear forced
its way slowly along an eyelid and down a thin cheek.</p>

<p>Just as she was about to turn away in the direction
of her club, an afterthought, swift and half-formed,
caused Hierons still to detain her.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just one thing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&mdash;that occurs
to me.&#8221; In odd contrast to his habitual air of
decision his voice was halting, his words fragmentary.
&#8220;There may ... may be a possibility ... and yet
no ... after all ... it hardly bears thinking about.&#8221;
In a fashion abrupt and strange he checked his words.
&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be wise to....&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen looked at him disconcertedly. The man who
was speaking was not the George Hierons she knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we won&#8217;t clutch at straws,&#8221; he said enigmatically.
&#8220;Let us continue to meet the facts of the case.
But whenever you want me, ring up my hotel and I
will come to you at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thanked him again. Then she turned and
walked slowly down the street.</p>

<p>For a minute or more he stood to watch that tragic
figure pass from view. An unspeakable oppression
weighed heavily upon him. And then in the midst of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
it, with a feeling that was half nausea, half elation,
a quick thought recalled to his mind that Lien Weng
was in London. He remembered, moreover, that the
President of the Council was staying at the Ritz.</p>

<p>As if drawn by a new chain of ideas Hierons
turned suddenly and crossed the road. One more brief
moment of reflection followed. Then slowly and sombrely
he made his way to the doors of the hotel.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">HELEN, in the meantime, had reached the end of
Dover Street and had entered her club. It was
now one o&#8217;clock, but she could not bear the thought of
food. Her mind was in a state of such imminent disruption
that it seemed to call for every resource of a
powerful will to hold it together.</p>

<p>She found an armchair in a quiet corner and gave
herself up to the task of calming her brain. A horrible
feeling of suffocation came to her, tinged with
physical agony. She felt as a mouse must feel when
caught in a trap.</p>

<p>All the same, the entire mechanism of a clear and
powerful intelligence was working furiously. A very
vigorous human animal was at bay. Every resource
that her body and soul possessed, and they possessed
many, had now come automatically into play. No matter
what the cost to others or to herself, she must save
the life of the man she loved.</p>

<p>Crudely stated that was the point her overdriven mind
had reached after she had spent a long hour trying to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
dragoon it. At the end of that time she sat down at
a table and took up a pen.</p>

<p>She had decided to send a letter to Saul Hartz saying
that she wished particularly to see him on an urgent
private matter. To this end she would invite him to
come and drink tea in her new house at four o&#8217;clock
on the following Friday or Saturday afternoon. Such
a letter was not at all easy to write. More than one
attempt had to be put in the waste paper basket before
she came near saying in the right way the particular
thing she wished to express.</p>

<p>With the letter composed at last more or less to her
mind, she dropped it in the post box in the hall and
went out of the Club. Turning into Bond Street,
she walked as far as a locksmith&#8217;s at the Oxford Street
end. Here she sought advice as to the means of opening
a patent Warlock fireproof safe, of which the key
had been mislaid.</p>

<p>A duplicate key was the suggested remedy. Helen
thereupon arranged that on the following afternoon
at four o&#8217;clock&mdash;at which hour John was sure to be
at the House or at one of his clubs&mdash;an expert should
come to Brompton Square and see what could be done
in the matter.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">LVI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE days that remained of a terrible week imposed
a strain upon Helen almost beyond what
she could bear. On the next afternoon the locksmith
came at the time appointed and was able to provide a
key to the safe out of the stock of keys in his possession.</p>

<p>As soon as the man had gone, Helen opened the
safe and satisfied herself that the phial in its gun-metal
case was still there. She had been given to
understand that a child might use it, so remarkably
simple was its operation. The colorless fluid, rather
less in quantity than one tenth of a liter, had merely
to be sprinkled on the coat of the victim at a point
contiguous to the spinal column. Death would then
ensue in three hours or less, without leaving a trace
of its cause.</p>

<p>With a sense of grim repulsion, Helen pressed the
tiny spring which held together the gun-metal case&mdash;a
thing of exquisite contrivance&mdash;and satisfied herself
that the phial and syringe were very much as she
expected to find them. Her horror of this devilish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
thing was very real. But to the best of her ability she
had thought out what had to be done. She saw herself
as the hapless instrument of destiny. And she
had not endured nine-and-twenty years of life without
a clear perception of the stern fact that its decrees,
no matter how ruthless, how savage, must be accepted.</p>

<p>She now awaited, with every spark of patience she
could muster, a reply to her letter to Saul Hartz. He
might not even deign to answer it. Or if answer he
did, being the man he was, with so many calls upon
his inadequate day of twenty-four hours, he was hardly
likely to find the time or to take the trouble to pay a
visit to Brompton Square. And in that event, which
seemed to grow more and more inevitable, what then
must be her course of action?</p>

<p>In the grip of a problem that would not bear thinking
about, Helen waited, every sense astretch, for the
arrival of each post. Three and four times a day she
flew to the letter box, in the vain hope of seeing the
crabbed, familiar handwriting of Saul Hartz lying in
it.</p>

<p>Would no answer come? In the course of a distracted
Wednesday that question became in her mind
a specter. In Fate&#8217;s hourglass the sands were running
out. Life was now so sharp a torment that it was
hardly bearable. Strong her will yet was and, in spite
of all, her faith still firm. And at the beck of some
power, not herself, she was called to play a part which
she believed to have the highest sanction.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>In the last resort, she was sure that the movements
of the Colossus, whose shadow might soon be lying
athwart the whole world, must be determined by Fate
itself. Was God&#8217;s hand strong enough to direct this
man to her house at the time she had proposed? It
was the sense and the knowledge of ultimate things
which kept Helen sane in the course of the intolerable
hours of that Wednesday night.</p>

<p>The next morning, after a vigil which seemed interminable,
she was down before eight o&#8217;clock. That
was the hour, as a rule, when the first post came.
Eagerly she listened for the familiar knock. And
when, just as the hour struck, the knock was plainly
heard, she could hardly muster courage to go as far
as the letter box in the hall. Go, however, she did.</p>

<p>There was a mail of eight letters. And among them
one, a small neat envelope, bore the unmistakable handwriting
which for two days past had been stamped
upon the retina of Helen&#8217;s imagination.</p>

<p>She tore the letter open. There was a brief line:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dear Helen</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly, with the greatest pleasure I will come
and see your new home at four o&#8217;clock Friday afternoon.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours always,</span><br />

&#8220;S. H.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LVII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE letter of the Colossus was characteristic.
Such cordial simplicity was so like him. In a keen
and swift recoil of feeling which cut like a knife,
Helen recalled the man as he had always seemed to
her. It was a case, if ever there was one, of multiple
personality. To her Saul Hartz had appeared a man
whose kindliness, charm, generosity it would have been
hard to exaggerate. There might have been motive
behind it all, but so far as Helen was concerned personally
there was no reason to think so. He liked her
because he liked her. The human beings for whom
the Colossus had a regard were not many, but certainly
she was among the chosen few admitted to the sunny
side of a nature complex, enigmatic, subtle beyond
analysis.</p>

<p>Helen now did not doubt that in sum the Colossus
was a bad man; a creature of abnormal powers of mind
who owed the workaday world of men and things a
grudge for having been born into it. He was a natural
enemy, who at the call of a perverted genius was ready
to under-pin civilization, that crazy structure, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
moment he got the chance. And that chance was surely
coming, unless&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>His friendly letter in hand, Helen had now to harden
the will with a brief restatement of a dreadful
plight. She was luring a man who on the surface was
simple and kindly to her house in order to do him to
death. As she sat down to breakfast opposite her husband
and toyed with dry toast and a cup of tea, a
ghoulish sense of nightmare seemed to cause the four
walls of their little dining room to contract.</p>

<p>John was very pale. He, too, had not slept. At
three o&#8217;clock he had got up and dressed and had spent
the night&#8217;s remaining hours downstairs among his
books. Helen saw that his hand was trembling as she
gave him his cup. He, too, was living on his nerves.</p>

<p>This long-drawn Thursday was for both an intolerable
day. They now stood together fighting with their
wills against an implacable destiny. John, some instinct
told her, was already trying to subdue the whole force
of his nature to the thought of death. Precisely in
what form it would overtake him or when it might
be expected to do so, he did all that he could not to
allow her to guess. But in the course of another
night in which neither of them closed their eyes, words
escaped his lips that gave her a clue to the mind process
which in the end would destroy him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Macbeth has murdered sleep,&#8221; he whispered to her
in the winter darkness. &#8220;This side the grave, my darling,
I shall never sleep again.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>She hugged him close, as a mother hugs a child.
Nature, she knew then, was nearing exhaustion. All
too soon the will that grappled him to life must relax.
And then in a moment of frenzy, of desperation, he
would kill himself.</p>

<p>It behooved her, as long as was possible, to delay
that moment. Friday was already here. And at four
o&#8217;clock that afternoon Saul Hartz had promised to
come to her. Pray Heaven that he did not fail!</p>

<p>As Helen lay in bed, however, listening hour by hour
to the chime of the clocks of many neighboring steeples,
she was haunted by a fear that the man by her side
would not be able to carry on through the day. One
stroke of a razor while he shaved, one step in front
of an electric train, what could be simpler? His controls
were yielding. Of that fact there were many indications.
The question was, could he now outlast this
all-important day?</p>

<p>Many times she had urged him to take a bromide,
but he had not done so. Such things were likely to
prove worse than futile. Death was the penalty he
inevitably would have to pay; and his mind and will
were at one in that, so far as his soul&#8217;s welfare was
concerned, it was best that death came to him through
his instincts working in a natural and unfettered way.</p>

<p>&#8220;If one bedevils oneself,&#8221; he argued, &#8220;with drugs
and potions one may lose control of one&#8217;s reason altogether.
And that will mean a state of aphasia compared
with which death is more than kind. Hell is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
mental condition. And there is none to equal that of
the man who longs for death and yet has not the nerve
to ensue it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen had felt bound to respect this attitude of mind.
But dressing now in the wintry dawn of Friday, the
question that harrowed her was, Could unaided nature
hold him to his course for another four-and-twenty
hours?</p>

<p>Immediately their pretense at breakfast was over,
they went to a church close by. Here they stayed
nearly three hours. And when they emerged from its
precincts into the December gloom, they felt far down
in their hearts that at the back of everything was still
a Friend who was surely helping them to keep their
sanity.</p>

<p>As evidence of this strength that had been given
them both were able to take a little food. And then
for Helen came the facing of the grim problem&mdash;How
did John propose to spend the afternoon?</p>

<p>She had hoped that he would go down to the House
of Commons. But as soon as luncheon was at an end
he retired to the room in which he worked. An hour
passed and yet he made no sign of going out. Presently
the clock struck three; and Helen, no longer able to
bear the suspense, came in and found him sitting apathetically
at his table, not attempting to write or to read.</p>

<p>Her instinct for the practical showed her now the
paramount need of making up his mind for him. She
determined to take a strong line.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s such an unpleasant afternoon that I am going
to get you a taxi.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes he lifted to hers seemed to have scarcely a
spark of life in them. &#8220;Why&mdash;a taxi?&#8221; he asked dully.</p>

<p>&#8220;To take you to the House.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going there again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you are,&#8221; she said quickly. &#8220;Just once
more&mdash;to please me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes that looked at her were those of a man who
was near the end of his tether. &#8220;But I said good-bye to
it yesterday,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>Plain sense now told her that all must depend on the
imperious exercise of her own strong will. She left
the room, to return almost at once with his coat and
hat. &#8220;Ferris has gone for a taxi,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he said wearily, &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel up to it
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make the effort, my darling&mdash;if only because I
ask you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loving her as he did, it was hard to refuse. The
spirit was willing, but alas he was no longer in command
of himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t stay long,&#8221; said Helen beguilingly.
&#8220;But in the name of that in which we both believe and
for the sake of the work we have still to do&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>As one compelled by sheer magnetism he got up
slowly from his chair. With resolute deftness she
fixed him up with his overcoat. &#8220;Promise me that
you will take a taxi home again.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>He didn&#8217;t say anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Promise,&#8221; she gently insisted. &#8220;Anyhow, I&#8217;ll promise
for you. And you&#8217;ll come back to me, won&#8217;t you?
Yes, you will.&#8221; She pressed her lips to his cold cheek.
&#8220;You shall&mdash;you must!&#8221;</p>

<p>With the same gentle insistence she led him out of
the room and through the tiny entrance hall. As if
he had been a small child going to a New Year&#8217;s party
she herded him into the taxi.</p>

<p>As she closed the door upon him, she put her head
through the lowered window with a little laugh that
was almost gay. &#8220;Something tells me that Providence
is working for us. Promise me, darling, that you&#8217;ll
take a taxi and come straight back home?&#8221;</p>

<p>As the taxi began to move she ran beside it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best,&#8221; he muttered as the taxi began to
outpace her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LVIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE now remained for Helen the task of awaiting
the arrival of Saul Hartz. Four o&#8217;clock was
the hour that he was due.</p>

<p>The rather tiny drawing room in which she intended
to receive him was quite a delight to the eye. It was
choice, seductive, trim. Much care and taste had been
lavished on the decorations, the hangings, the general
scheme. A bright fire burned on a cosy hearth of blue
and white Dutch tiles. Everything was a harmony
of delicate blues and greens. No room could have been
more civilized. It was really fantastic that a creature
like herself, one whose mind was humane, creative,
essentially modern, essentially sane, should have invited
a man to such a room in order to murder him.</p>

<p>That aspect of the case didn&#8217;t bear thinking about.
And with a courage that showed no sign of failing now
the crisis was at hand she put it away from her. She
went to the safe in the other room to procure the phial.
But as she was in the act of unlocking its heavy door,
a paralyzing thought flashed along her nerves.</p>

<p>Suppose ... suppose ... the phial was not there!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>It was more than likely that John had now reached
a state of mind when he could carry this deadly thing
about with him for use upon himself. It was such a
simple, convenient mode of exit from the world. As
the door of the safe yielded to the key, she had a thrill
of pure fright. This new hypothesis had a touch of
inevitability that appalled her. But the fear instantly
passed. There, in the place in which she had last seen
it, was the gun-metal case.</p>

<p>A careful examination told her that as far as she
could learn the apparatus was in working order. She
took it accordingly to the drawing room and set it on
the chimneypiece in a place easily accessible, behind a
charming Wedgwood vase. Next it was a pretty little
French clock which soon chimed half past three.</p>

<p>She then took up a piece of needlework and began
with skilful fingers to weave a mosaic of colored silks.
All too soon, however, she discovered that she was not
quite superhuman. After five minutes or so she was
compelled to put it down. Every nerve in her body
was in a state of mutiny.</p>

<p>Several books from the circulating library were on
a small table near her hand. The first she took up
was entitled <i>New Uses for the Will: a translation from
the Chinese of Lien Weng</i>. Involuntarily her glance
strayed towards the chimneypiece and the Wedgwood
vase. The coincidence made her shiver.</p>

<p>She set the book down as if it had been a live coal.
Then she got up and began feverishly to pace the room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
For one horrid moment she had the illusion again that
its four walls were closing in upon her. But it was
dispelled for the time being by the entrance of the
parlor maid with a silver tray containing tea things.</p>

<p>The clock on the chimneypiece began melodiously
to chime four.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that clock right, Ferris?&#8221; The high thin voice,
as heard by herself, sounded to Helen quite unlike
her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, m&#8217;m, I believe so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t draw the curtains. I&#8217;ll attend to those
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, m&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>The parlor maid went out of the room.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS none knew better than Helen, it was a foible of
the Colossus always to be &#8220;on time.&#8221; Punctuality
is the soul of business, she had heard him say was
his favorite aphorism.</p>

<p>The minutes ticked on, however, and she listened in
vain for a ring at the front door bell. She went up to
the drawing-room window and looked down into the
Square. The street lamp, just opposite the front door,
was already lit. The December evening was fast
closing in. She listened tensely for the sound of an
approaching car. Her eyes tried to pierce the fog,
which after hanging about all day had increased considerably
during the last hour.</p>

<p>A quarter past four struck. Helen had now ceased
to think of anything she did, but proceeded to draw
the heavy curtains across the window. And then
guided by the bright glow of the fire she went to the
door and switched on the light.</p>

<p>All at once it dawned upon her that now she would
have to meet a fact that as yet had not taken shape
in her mind. The Colossus might not come. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
so unlike him to be late. And he was such a busy
man, with so many calls upon his time, that something
might have intervened at the last moment to prevent
his coming. But in that case, she argued, man of
method as he was and respecter in small matters of the
rights of others, he would almost certainly have let her
know.</p>

<p>While her mind was busy with these pros and cons
the clock moved steadily on. It chimed the half hour.
More and more positive she grew that Saul Hartz
would not come now. Her mind began to reach out
tentatively to meet the new and unforeseen situation.
The one hope she had, a desperate and perhaps a fantastic
hope, of saving her husband&#8217;s life seemed already
to have passed away.</p>

<p>She rang for the tea. It was necessary to do something,
even if it involved a trivial action, in order to
keep a hold of the will. The tea was wormwood in
her mouth, but she was able to drink one cup. And
then, with the walls of the room closing in upon her
more surely than ever, she lay down on the sofa.</p>

<p>The clock chimed five. Her mind grew numb. All
power of action was ebbing away from her. She realized
that she could do no more. But half dazed as
she was by the strong and cruel reaction that had already
set in, she yet heard the honk honk of a motor
as it entered the Square, followed at once by a sound
of wheels.</p>

<p>Intensely she listened for the ring of the front door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
bell. But she listened in vain. In her excitement she
got up from the sofa on which she sat. Hardly had she
done so when the door opened, and John came into
the room.</p>

<p>He was still wearing his overcoat and hat. In his
ashen face was a look of burning intensity. They stood
a moment looking at each other in a silence that was
rather grotesque.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling ... tell me ... what has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>Endor did not answer the question. Or rather, he
answered it by taking from a pocket of his overcoat
&#8220;the late extra&#8221; edition of the <i>Evening Press</i>. The
front page was draped heavily in thick mourning
lines. He folded back the paper, set his finger on the
middle column, and then handed it to Helen.</p>

<p>Her head swam round as she read:</p>

<p class="center">TRAGIC DEATH OF SAUL HARTZ</p>

<p>The salient facts of the occurrence were that</p>

<p>The uncanny silence which gripped them was broken
at last by Endor&#8217;s high-pitched laugh. &#8220;First with the
news as usual,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The still half-terrified eyes of Helen strayed from
the ashen face of her husband, in which a new light was
breaking, to the chimneypiece and its blue Wedgwood
vase. &#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she gasped, &#8220;I wonder!&#8221;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
